**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement directly describes a specific action a user can perform within the system – adding time and duration to a class. This clearly relates to the system's core functionality and how users interact with it. It’s not a non-functional requirement (like performance or security) but rather a feature that defines what the system *does*.



**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement – “System shall ensure that transactions reflect accurately in databases without any data loss” – describes a quality attribute of the system. It’s not a specific feature (like “user login”) but rather a characteristic of how the system *should* behave.  It focuses on data integrity and reliability, which are core aspects of non-functional requirements (also known as quality attributes). 

Here's why it's not a functional requirement:

*   **Focus on Behavior:** It describes *how* the system operates (accurate transaction recording) rather than *what* the system does (e.g., process a payment, create a record).
*   **Data Integrity:** It’s fundamentally about data integrity – a key non-functional requirement.


**Functional**

Here’s why:

*   **Defines a specific capability:** This requirement clearly outlines a feature – the ability to create visually engaging content through editing tools.

**Non-Functional Requirement**

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on Quality Attribute:** This requirement isn’t about *what* the system does (a functional requirement). It’s about *how* it’s designed and experienced – the usability, intuitiveness, and overall user satisfaction.  These are core aspects of quality attributes like Usability.
*   **Impact on Other Requirements:**  Adhering to UX best practices will directly influence the design of the user interface, which in turn impacts the system’s functionality and how easily it can be used.

**Therefore, classifying it as a Non-Functional Requirement is the most accurate.**


**Non-Functional Requirement**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a *quality* of the system – how it *should* behave – rather than a specific feature or function. It’s about the *experience* a user has when interacting with the system.  It’s a characteristic of the system’s performance (e.g., responsiveness, efficiency) and doesn’t define a particular piece of functionality.  It’s about the *quality* of the customer service provided *by* the system.



**Non-Functional Requirement** 

Here’s why:

*   **Addresses System Behavior:** This requirement describes a specific contingency plan for handling data that’s difficult to obtain automatically. It’s not a core feature of the system but rather a process to ensure data completeness.
*   **Impacts Development Effort:** It implies a manual intervention, which directly affects the development timeline and resources.
*   **Risk Mitigation:** It’s a way to mitigate the risk of incomplete data.

**Functional Requirement**

This requirement describes a specific, demonstrable function of the system – displaying a list of nearby sites with links. It’s about *what* the system does. 

Here’s why it’s classified as functional:

*   **Actionable:** It specifies a clear action the system must perform (displaying a list).
*   **Measurable:** The outcome (a list with specific criteria – nearest, alphabetical, links) can be verified.

Let me know if you’d like to classify another requirement!


**Functional Requirement:**

This requirement directly describes a specific action the system *must* perform – allowing data package restoration via the command-line interface. It’s a core feature and dictates system behavior.

**Classification:**

*   **Priority:** High – This is a feature that users (Data Publishers) will likely rely on.
*   **Type:** Data Management, Recovery
*   **Verification Method:** Testing –  Needs to be thoroughly tested to ensure the command-line interface works correctly and the data is restored accurately.

Do you want me to elaborate on any aspect of this classification, or perhaps provide a more detailed description of the requirement itself?


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific action a user can perform within the system – entering ratings. It directly relates to a core function of the system (presumably evaluating something based on an audit report).  It’s not a constraint on *how* the system works, but rather *what* a user can do with it.


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a core action a user can perform within the system – modifying their personal information. This directly relates to how the system *functions* and what a user can *do* with it. It’s not a constraint on the system’s behavior or performance, but rather a capability.
