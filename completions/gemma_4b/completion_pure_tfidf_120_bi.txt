**Non-Functional Requirement:** The phrase "accurately handle" and "reload if necessary" strongly suggest a performance and reliability aspect. It implies the system needs to be responsive and maintain data integrity during this process. 

**Overall Classification:** **Functional with Performance/Reliability Implications** 

Here's a breakdown of why:

*   **Functional:** It defines a core user action – processing data for recommendations.
*   **Non-Functional (Performance/Reliability):** The need for “accurate handling” and “reloading if necessary” indicates that the system must perform this task efficiently and reliably, likely with considerations for data consistency and responsiveness.


**Availability** 

This requirement falls squarely into the category of **Availability**. It’s explicitly stating the need for continuous operation – 24 hours a day, 7 days a week – without downtime. 

Here’s why it’s classified as Availability:

*   **Focus on Uptime:** The core concern is that the server *must* be operational.
*   **Service Continuity:** It emphasizes uninterrupted service delivery.

Let me know if you’d like me to classify another requirement!


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a system behavior – the notification the user receives. It’s not about *what* the system does (like adding an item to a list), but *how* it behaves and responds to an action.  Notifications are a key aspect of system responsiveness and user experience, making it a non-functional requirement. 

Here's why it's not a functional requirement:

*   **Focus on Behavior:** It describes *how* the system reacts to a user action (initiating shipment).
*   **Not Core Functionality:** It’s not a core feature like “ship an item” itself.


**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, a **Usability** requirement.

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on User Experience:** This requirement directly addresses how easy it is for *non-programmers* to maintain the system. It’s about simplifying a task for a specific user group.
*   **Maintainability:** Customization options are crucial for making the system easier to maintain by those without technical expertise.
*   **Not Core Functionality:** It’s not about *what* the system does, but *how* it’s presented and modified.

This requirement is **Functional**.

Here’s why: It describes a specific feature – the creation and operation of FABS groups – and its relationship to a defined process (the FREC paradigm). This directly relates to what the system *does*. 

Let’s break it down:

*   **“Developer shall provide FABS groups…”** – This is a task – creating groups.
*   **“…that function under the FREC paradigm.”** – This specifies *how* those groups should operate, linking them to a particular methodology.

Therefore, it’s a clear statement of a functional requirement.


**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, a **Security Requirement**.

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on *how* the restaurant owner account is created and managed to ensure security. It’s not about the functionality of the account itself (like what features it has), but rather about a specific security measure – preventing duplicate usernames.  Non-functional requirements typically describe *how well* something works, rather than *what* it does.


**Functional**

**Reasoning:** This requirement describes a specific piece of information that should be presented to the user – the display of recent jobs. It’s about *what* the system does, not *how* it does it (performance, scalability, etc.).  It’s a core feature of the system.


**Functional Requirement**

**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes *what* the system should do – it specifies a particular interface (Linked Data) for accessing and interacting with the repository data.  It’s about a specific functionality and how data is presented and accessed, rather than a constraint on *how* the system operates (e.g., performance, security).  Therefore, it falls squarely into the functional category.



**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, it falls under **Quality Attribute: Testability**.

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on Process:** The requirement emphasizes the *need* for test environments, not the functionality itself. It’s about the *process* of ensuring quality.
*   **Impact on Design:**  The need for test environments directly impacts the system’s design and architecture.
*   **Measurable Aspect:**  The quality of the test environments themselves can be evaluated (e.g., coverage, effectiveness).

**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a quality attribute of the system – its security. It’s not about *what* the system does (like storing data or generating reports), but rather *how* it performs those actions securely. Security requirements are almost always categorized as non-functional because they define qualities like confidentiality, integrity, availability, and performance, rather than specific behaviors.


**Functional Requirement**

This requirement directly relates to a specific function – assigning versions to datasets. It’s about a core capability of the system. 

Here’s why it’s classified as functional:

*   **Actionable:** It describes what the system *must do* – allow developers to assign versions.
*   **Specific:** It details a particular feature – versioning datasets.

Would you like me to elaborate on why this is a functional requirement, or perhaps suggest a more detailed description of it?


Functional


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a quality attribute of the system – its visual design and adherence to established UI standards for mobile devices. It’s not a specific feature or behavior, but rather a characteristic that impacts the user experience and overall system quality.  It’s about *how* the system looks and feels, not *what* it does.


**Functional Requirement**

This requirement describes a specific action a user (a “worker”) can perform within the system – marking tasks as completed. It dictates a core system functionality.

**Non-Functional Requirement (Quality Attribute):** Robustness

**Reasoning:**

The requirement "System shall be robust" directly relates to a quality attribute – robustness. Robustness describes a system’s ability to handle unexpected inputs, errors, and stresses without failing or producing incorrect results. It’s a core characteristic of a reliable and dependable system. 

Here's why it's not a functional requirement (which describes *what* the system does) but a quality attribute (which describes *how well* it does it):

*   **Focus on Resilience:** "Robust" implies resilience, fault tolerance, and the ability to withstand adverse conditions.
*   **Broad Scope:** Robustness encompasses various aspects like error handling, data integrity, and system stability.


**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, a Security Requirement.

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on Security:** The requirement explicitly mentions “secured database,” directly addressing a critical aspect of system design – data protection.
*   **Impact on System Behavior:**  How the database is secured (encryption, access controls, etc.) will significantly influence the overall system’s behavior and reliability.
*   **Not a Core Feature:** It’s not about *what* the system does (like displaying information or processing orders) but *how* it handles data, which is a fundamental non-functional concern.

**Functional Requirement**

This requirement clearly describes a specific action a user can take within the system – marking attendance. It’s a core function the system must support. 

Here’s why it’s classified as functional:

*   **Action-Oriented:** It specifies *what* the user can do.
*   **System Behavior:** It dictates a specific behavior of the system (allowing attendance marking).

Would you like me to elaborate on why it’s a functional requirement, or perhaps suggest related categories (e.g., user interface, data input)?


**Non-Functional Requirement (NFR) - Availability**

This requirement falls squarely into the category of availability. Specifically, it’s a quantifiable target for uptime. 

Here's a breakdown of why:

*   **Quantifiable:** “99.5%” is a specific percentage, making it measurable.
*   **Focus on Uptime:** It directly addresses how often the system is operational and accessible to users.
*   **Service Level Agreement (SLA) Potential:** This type of requirement is often used to define a Service Level Agreement (SLA) between a provider and a customer.

Would you like me to elaborate on how this type of NFR is typically handled in requirements documentation or testing?


**Functional Requirement**

This requirement clearly describes a core function of the system – managing user accounts through authentication and signup processes. It’s about *what* the system *does*. 

Here’s why it’s classified as functional:

*   **Action-Oriented:** It specifies an action – authenticating logins and signups.
*   **Core System Behavior:** It’s a fundamental aspect of how the system operates.

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this classification, or perhaps provide a more detailed breakdown of the requirement?


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific action the system *must do* – it needs to “harvest” metadata. It’s about a defined process and outcome (analysis and strategy refinement).  It’s not a quality attribute like performance or security, but rather a core function of the system.


**Functional Requirement:** This requirement directly relates to a core function of the system – handling customer issues with their orders. It specifies a key action users can take.

**Classification:**  **Order Management / Issue Resolution** 

**Reasoning:**  The requirement clearly outlines a process for dealing with problems with an order (replacement or cancellation). This falls squarely within the domain of managing orders and resolving customer issues. 

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a system characteristic – the ability to adapt and evolve to meet future data analysis demands. It’s not a specific feature or function, but rather a quality of the system’s design and architecture.  Non-functional requirements (NFRs) typically address aspects like performance, scalability, maintainability, and adaptability – all of which this requirement falls under.


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement clearly describes a core function of the system – managing user authentication (login) and processing payments, specifically using bankcards. It’s about *what* the system *does*.  It’s not a non-functional requirement like performance or security, but rather a specific task the system must perform.



**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a *principle* or *guideline* that should be followed during the design process. It’s not a specific feature, functionality, or behavior of the system. Instead, it’s a quality attribute – in this case, a focus on good UX design. Non-functional requirements often relate to qualities like usability, performance, security, or maintainability, and this falls squarely into the realm of usability (a key aspect of UX).


**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, this falls under **Performance & Usability**. 

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on Outcome:** The requirement isn’t about *what* the system does (like processing an order), but *how* it does it – providing solutions.
*   **Customer Experience:** It directly relates to the quality of the customer experience – a key aspect of usability.
*   **Performance Implication:** “Feasible solutions” implies efficiency and effectiveness, which ties into system performance.

**Non-Functional**

Here’s why:

*   **It describes a contingency plan:** This requirement outlines what happens when data extraction fails automatically. It’s a fallback mechanism.
*   **It’s about robustness and error handling:** It’s not about the core functionality of the system, but rather how the system handles exceptional circumstances.
*   **It’s a process, not a feature:** It describes a manual intervention, not a feature that users directly interact with.

**Functional Requirement**

This requirement clearly describes a specific action the system must perform – generating and displaying a ranked list of sites. It’s a core function the system needs to execute. 

Here’s why it’s classified as functional:

*   **Action-Oriented:** It specifies *what* the system needs to do (provide a list).
*   **Specific Criteria:** It outlines the criteria for the list (3 nearest sites, sorted alphabetically).
*   **Measurable:** The outcome (a list meeting these criteria) can be verified.


**Functional Requirement**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific action a user (a publisher) can perform within the system – restoring a deleted data package. It dictates *what* the system must do.  It’s not a constraint on *how* the system does it, just the capability to perform the action.  Therefore, it falls squarely into the category of a functional requirement.


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific action a user can take within the system – entering ratings. It directly relates to a system function and its intended use. It’s not a constraint on performance, security, or usability – those would be non-functional requirements.


**Functional Requirement**

This requirement clearly describes a core function of the system – allowing users to modify their profile information. It’s a fundamental aspect of user management and personalization. 

Here’s why it’s classified as functional:

*   **Actionable:** It specifies a specific action a user can take within the system.
*   **Impact:** It directly affects the user’s profile data and how it’s presented.
