Non-functional


**Functional Requirement**

This requirement falls squarely into the category of a functional requirement. It describes *what* the system must do – allow a user to play Mahjong – regardless of their existing knowledge. It’s a core feature of the application.

Here's why it's not other classifications:

*   **Non-Functional:** It doesn't describe a quality like performance, security, or usability.
*   **Business Requirement:** It’s a feature request, not a strategic goal.
*   **User Story:** While it could be part of a user story ("As a new player, I want to be able to play Mahjong without needing to learn the rules beforehand"), the core classification is still functional.

Would you like me to elaborate on why this is a functional requirement, or perhaps suggest a more detailed way to phrase it for a requirements document?

**Classification:** **UI Customization / Themeing**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement directly addresses the ability to modify the visual presentation of the application’s interface. Specifically, it focuses on changing the *text elements* – essentially, the fonts, colors, and potentially the text content itself – within the application’s user interface. This falls squarely within the category of UI customization or themeing, allowing for personalization and potentially adapting the interface to different user preferences or branding needs. 

It’s not about data manipulation, functionality changes, or system configuration – it’s purely about the *look and feel* of the interface.


**Functional:** This requirement describes *what* the system does – it specifies the operating system (UNIX) and the core function (archival system). 

Therefore, the classification is **Functional**.



Functional


Functional


**Non-Functional** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on the *technical* aspect of data storage and preservation – ensuring the audit trail exists for legal and recovery purposes. It’s about the system’s behavior and capabilities, rather than the specific functionality being provided to the user.  It’s a requirement for data integrity and system reliability, which falls under the category of non-functional requirements.

Non-functional


**Non-Functional Requirement (Performance)**

Here’s the breakdown of why it’s classified as a Non-Functional Requirement – specifically a Performance Requirement:

*   **Focus on System Behavior:** This requirement isn’t about *what* the system does (e.g., “The system must return search results”) but *how well* it does it. It’s about the speed and responsiveness of the search function.
*   **Measurable:** The requirement includes specific targets (2 seconds, ideally 1 second) and a method for measuring it (1000 searches during testing). This is a key characteristic of non-functional requirements.
*   **Impact on User Experience:**  A slow search response time would negatively impact the user experience.

**Key Characteristics of a Non-Functional Requirement:**

*   Often describes qualities like performance, security, usability, reliability, scalability, etc.
*   Typically expressed as constraints or targets (e.g., “must be within X seconds”).
*   Doesn’t directly dictate the system’s functionality but influences how that functionality is implemented.

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this classification, or perhaps provide an example of how this type of requirement would be documented in a requirements specification?


Functional


Non-functional


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a fallback mechanism – what the system *does* if something isn’t provided by another system (ESOC). It’s about system behavior and resilience, not the core functionality being delivered. It’s about how the system handles a potential failure or missing input, rather than the data itself. Therefore, it falls under the category of non-functional requirements, specifically related to robustness and error handling.


Functional


**Functional:** This requirement describes a core system function – the approval workflow for requests. It outlines the process of review, notification, and status updates.

**Priority:** High – This is a fundamental requirement for managing requests and ensuring efficient operations.

**Keywords:** Approval Workflow, Request Management, Notifications, Status Updates, User Roles.


Functional


Functional



**Non-Functional Requirement**

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on Behavior/Performance:** This requirement describes *how* the system behaves (displaying results or a "no matches" message) rather than *what* the system does (e.g., searching a database).
*   **Performance/Error Handling:** It’s fundamentally about the system’s response to a query – a core aspect of system performance and error handling.
*   **Testability:** It’s easily testable – you can verify that the system displays the correct message under different conditions (successful search, no results).

**Therefore, it’s a Non-Functional Requirement (NFR)** – specifically related to system behavior, performance, and error handling.

Would you like me to elaborate on why this is classified as a non-functional requirement, or perhaps provide a more detailed description of its characteristics?


**Security & Access Control**

This requirement falls squarely into the category of **Security & Access Control**. It dictates that sensitive information (bidder details and quantity) is restricted to authorized personnel – specifically, administrators. This is a fundamental security principle – least privilege. 

Here’s why it’s classified this way:

*   **Data Sensitivity:** The information is likely considered sensitive, potentially impacting competitive bidding processes.
*   **Role-Based Access:** It clearly defines access rights based on user roles (Admin vs. other users).
*   **Protection Against Unauthorized Access:** The requirement aims to prevent unauthorized individuals from gaining insight into bidding strategies.

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this classification, or perhaps suggest related requirements that might be relevant?

*   **System Impact:**  Changing the assignment name will directly affect the system’s data and how assignments are tracked.

Would you like me to provide a short justification for this classification?


**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, a **Service Level Agreement (SLA)** requirement.

**Reasoning:**

*   **“Shall be available”** – This indicates a desired state of operation.
*   **“24/7”** – This defines the availability expectation, a key component of an SLA.

It’s not a functional requirement because it doesn’t describe *what* the system *does*, but rather *how well* it performs (its availability).


**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, this falls under **Usability** and **Reliability**.

Here’s why:

*   **Usability:** A clear, informative error message directly impacts the user’s ability to understand and correct the problem, improving the overall user experience.
*   **Reliability:**  A robust error message helps ensure the system behaves predictably and doesn’t silently fail, preventing data loss or further issues.

It’s not a functional requirement (defining *what* the system does) but rather a requirement about *how* the system behaves when something goes wrong.


Functional



**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, a **Performance Requirement** or **Availability Requirement**.

Here’s why:

*   **Availability:** This requirement directly impacts the system’s ability to be *available* for use. Without an internet connection, the system is effectively unavailable.
*   **Performance:** It also relates to performance, as the system’s responsiveness and functionality are entirely dependent on a network connection.

It’s not a functional requirement (like “The system shall allow users to log in”) because it describes a *condition* for the system to operate.


Functional


Functional



Non-functional


**Non-Functional Requirement (Performance)**

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on Capacity:** This requirement directly addresses the system’s ability to handle a high volume of transactions – a core performance characteristic.
*   **Quantifiable Metric:** It specifies a precise number (20,000 transactions per minute) – a key element of performance requirements.
*   **Context – Peak Workload:** The phrase “peak workload conditions” clarifies that this is a stress test scenario, not a typical operating condition.

**Classification Breakdown:**

*   **Category:** Performance
*   **Type:** Capacity/Throughput
*   **Priority:** Likely High – Handling a large volume of transactions is critical for many applications.

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this classification or perhaps generate a more formal requirement statement based on this?

These are technical specifications that dictate the system’s architecture and potentially impact performance, scalability, and development effort.  It’s not a business requirement or a user-facing feature.

**Functional Requirement**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement directly dictates *what* the system *does*. It defines a specific action a user can take – controlling how expenses are distributed. It’s not just a characteristic of the system, but a core function it must perform. 

Here's a breakdown of why it’s not other classifications:

*   **Non-Functional:** It doesn’t describe a quality like performance, security, or usability.
*   **Data Requirement:** It’s not simply about *storing* data; it’s about *processing* it to determine how an expense is split.

**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific action the user can take within the system – saving their changes. It dictates a clear user interaction (clicking a button) and the resulting system behavior (presenting a window for file/database selection). This directly relates to how the system processes and stores data, making it a core functional requirement. 

Here's why it's *not* purely Non-Functional: While the *implementation* might involve technical details (like file paths or database connections), the requirement itself focuses on the user's ability to save their modifications, which is a fundamental function of the system.

**Functional Requirement**

This requirement clearly describes a specific action a user can perform – modifying asset data. The inclusion of “bulk entry files” further specifies a supported method for this action.

**Here’s a breakdown of why it’s classified as functional:**

*   **Actionable:** It dictates *what* a user can do (modify assets).
*   **Specific:** It details *how* the modification can be done (through a specific method – bulk entry files).
*   **Measurable:**  The system’s behavior can be tested to ensure the user can successfully modify the specified fields and utilize bulk entry files.

**Would you like me to categorize it further, perhaps by priority or type (e.g., data modification, bulk import)?**


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a process – the system *doing* something (improving the database) based on data (learning from the prior month). It’s a core function of the system.  It’s not a constraint, performance metric, or user interface element. It’s about the system’s operation and learning.



**Category:** Availability & Reliability

**Specific Sub-Category:** Fault Tolerance / Redundancy

**Explanation:** This requirement directly addresses the system’s ability to remain operational despite potential hardware or software failures. It’s a core aspect of ensuring the system’s overall availability and reliability.

**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, a UI/UX requirement.

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes *how* the GUI will function – namely, accepting keyboard input. It’s not a functional requirement (what the system *does*) but rather a characteristic of the user interface. It’s about the interaction between the user and the system’s graphical elements.



**Functional Requirement**

This requirement clearly describes a specific action a user (the customer) must perform within the system – entering personal details during the checkout process. It’s directly tied to a system function (checkout) and specifies the data required. 

Here’s why it’s classified as functional:

*   **Action-Oriented:** It describes *what* the user needs to do.
*   **System Impact:** It dictates a specific data input that the system must handle.

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Non-Functional Requirement**

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on User Experience:** The requirement explicitly states a focus on “user experience” – usability, clarity, and a visually-appealing design. These are core aspects of a non-functional requirement.
*   **Quality Attribute:** This falls under the quality attribute of *Usability*. It’s about how easy and pleasant the system is to use.
*   **Not a Specific Functionality:** It doesn’t describe *what* the system *does* (e.g., processing payments). It describes *how* it should be presented and experienced.

**Therefore, classifying it as a Non-Functional Requirement is the most accurate assessment.**


Non-functional


**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, it falls under **Usability** and **Reliability**.

Here’s why:

*   **Usability:**  Error handling directly impacts the user’s ability to effectively use the system.  Smooth error handling contributes to a positive user experience.
*   **Reliability:** Robust error handling is a key component of a reliable system – it prevents crashes, unexpected behavior, and data loss.

It’s not a functional requirement (which describes *what* the system does) but rather a characteristic of *how* it performs.


**Functional Requirement**

This requirement directly relates to a specific function of the system – allowing users to define a time range for the historical data displayed in the diagnostic history window. It’s a core feature impacting how the system presents and displays information. 

Here’s why it’s classified as functional:

*   **Actionable:** It describes what the user *can do* within the system (select a time range).
*   **Impacts System Behavior:** It dictates how the diagnostic history window will filter and display data.

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this classification?


**Functional Requirement**

This requirement clearly describes a specific action a user can perform within the Disputes System – searching for cases. It outlines the search criteria (fields to search by) and filtering options. Therefore, it falls squarely into the category of a functional requirement.

**Specifically, it’s a Search Requirement.**

Would you like me to elaborate on why it’s classified this way, or perhaps suggest a more detailed breakdown of its components?

**Non-Functional Requirement (Performance)**

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on Performance:** This requirement directly addresses the *performance* of the system – specifically, the speed and capacity of the connection between the client and server.
*   **Measurable:** “At least 20 Mbps” is a quantifiable metric, making it a performance requirement.
*   **Impacts User Experience:** Bandwidth directly affects the responsiveness and usability of the application.

Let's look at why other classifications wouldn't fit:

*   **Functional:** It doesn't describe *what* the system does, but *how* it performs.
*   **Security:** It’s not related to security aspects like authentication or encryption.
*   **Usability:** While performance impacts usability, this requirement is about the technical capacity of the connection, not the user experience.


Functional


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a design principle – optimizing for a streamlined, easy-to-navigate user interface. It focuses on *how* the system should be designed to achieve a specific user experience goal (reducing scrolling).  It’s not a feature itself, but a constraint or guideline for development.  Non-functional requirements (NFRs) typically address qualities like performance, usability, reliability, and security – all of which this requirement falls under.


Functional


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific action the system *must* perform – linking events to other applications. This directly relates to the system’s core functionality and how it interacts with other components. It’s not a performance characteristic (like speed) or a user interface element, but rather a defined process the system needs to execute.


Non-functional


**Non-Functional Requirement (NFR) - Performance**

Specifically, it falls under **Response Time**. 

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on Speed:** The requirement directly addresses the speed at which the server responds to requests.
*   **Measurable:** “Less than or equal to 2 seconds” provides a quantifiable target.
*   **Impacts User Experience:** Response time is a critical factor in user satisfaction and overall system usability.

**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a *behavior* of the client application – its ability to handle and interpret the response from the server (which is likely JSON). It’s not about *what* the system does, but *how* it handles the data it receives.  Non-functional requirements (NFRs) typically focus on qualities like performance, reliability, usability, or security – all of which are relevant here in terms of how the client *deals* with the data.  It’s a characteristic of the client’s implementation, not a core feature of the system itself.

**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific action the system *must* be able to perform – sending a bulk request to a group of users. It’s a defined capability of the system, not a constraint on its performance or behavior.  It’s about what the system *does*.

Here’s why it’s not other classifications:

*   **Non-Functional:** It doesn’t relate to performance, security, usability, or any other characteristic of the system.
*   **Data:** It’s not about the *type* of data, but the *action* performed with data.

**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on the *process* of testing – the need for well-defined test environments. It’s about *how* the application is tested, not about what the application *does* or its features.  Testing environments are a crucial aspect of ensuring quality (a non-functional requirement), but the requirement itself describes the *method* of achieving that quality. 

Here's why the other classifications don't fit:

*   **Functional:** This describes a specific feature or behavior of the application.
*   **Usability:** While testing contributes to usability, this requirement is broader than just ease of use.

**Non-Functional Requirement**

Here’s why:

*   **Addresses System Behavior:** This requirement describes a specific *response* the system should take when it encounters a problem (difficult data extraction). It’s not about *what* the system does in a normal scenario, but how it handles an exceptional situation.
*   **Impacts Performance/Reliability:**  Manual intervention directly impacts the system’s ability to operate efficiently and reliably. It introduces a potential bottleneck and a deviation from the intended automated process.
*   **Error Handling/Fallback:** This is a fallback mechanism – a way to ensure data is still added to the database even if the automated extraction fails.

**Therefore, it’s classified as a Non-Functional Requirement (specifically, an Error Handling or Fallback Requirement).**


**Functional Requirement**

This requirement clearly describes a specific action the system must perform – retrieving and presenting a ranked list of sites. It dictates the number of results, the sorting criteria, and the inclusion of links.  Therefore, it falls squarely within the realm of functional requirements. 

**Priority:** High – This is a core feature expected in a site directory or search application.


**Functional Requirement**

This requirement directly describes a specific action the system *must* perform – allowing publishers to restore deleted data packages via a command-line interface. It’s a core function of the system.

Here’s why it’s classified as functional:

*   **Action-Oriented:** It specifies a defined action (restoring data packages).
*   **System Behavior:** It dictates how the system responds to a specific user request.

Would you like me to elaborate on why it’s classified this way, or perhaps provide a more detailed breakdown of its characteristics?
