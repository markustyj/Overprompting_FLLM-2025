**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a core *functionality* of the system – determining eligibility for a specific program based on cohort membership. It’s about *what* the system *does*, not a constraint on *how* it does it (e.g., performance, security, etc.). It’s a core piece of the system’s logic.


**Non-Functional Requirement (NFR)** – Specifically, this falls under **Performance & Security**.

Here’s the breakdown:

*   **Restriction/Access Control:** The requirement dictates *who* can perform an action (advertise empty time slots). This directly relates to security and access control.
*   **Performance Implication:** The phrase "ensure that supervisors are allowed to access" implies a need for a system that efficiently manages and grants access rights, which can impact performance.

**Therefore, it’s classified as an NFR focused on security and access control with performance considerations.**


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes *what* the system needs to do – generate a report detailing class needs for specific groups of students. It focuses on the functionality and output of the system, rather than performance characteristics (like speed) or constraints (like security).

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a core capability of the product – storing information about room equipment. It’s about *what* the product *does*, not a constraint on *how* it does it (like performance or security).  It’s a fundamental feature.


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a future development effort – translating the product into different languages. It focuses on a *capability* and a *timeframe* for achieving that capability. It’s not a core feature of the product itself, but rather a planned enhancement.  It’s about *how* the product will function in the future, rather than *what* the product does. 

Here's why it doesn't fit into the other categories:

*   **Functional:** It doesn't define a specific action or process the product performs.
*   **Performance:** While it mentions a timeframe (5 days), this is related to the *effort* involved, not a measurable performance metric.
*   **Data:** It doesn't relate to data storage, retrieval, or manipulation.


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a performance and longevity expectation of the system. It’s not a specific feature or behavior, but rather a constraint on how well the system *must* operate over time.

Usability is a key aspect of a system’s overall quality and is typically measured through metrics like learnability, efficiency, memorability, and error reduction.  It’s not a specific feature or function, but rather a quality attribute that impacts the user experience. 

Here's why it doesn't fit into the other categories:

*   **Functional:** It doesn't describe *what* the system does, but *how well* it's used.
*   **Performance:** It’s not directly about speed or responsiveness.
*   **Security:** It doesn't relate to data protection or access control.


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a constraint on *how* the system should operate – specifically, the formatting of requests. It’s not about *what* the system does (like adding a student or generating a report), but rather a technical limitation on its behavior.  Non-functional requirements often deal with qualities like performance, reliability, maintainability, or usability – all of which this requirement falls under.


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement specifically addresses *performance* – the speed at which the system responds under a particular network condition (a 56k connection). Performance characteristics are inherently non-functional because they describe *how* the system behaves, rather than *what* it does. It’s a constraint on the system’s behavior, not a feature or function.


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a *schedule* for a maintenance activity (application updates). It’s not about *what* the application does, but *when* it’s updated.  Non-functional requirements typically deal with qualities like performance, availability, reliability, and constraints like timing. This falls squarely into the constraint category – specifically, a scheduled maintenance window.


**Non-Functional** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement dictates a constraint on *how* the system operates – specifically, limiting access to data based on user roles. This falls squarely into the category of non-functional requirements, which define qualities like security, performance, and usability. It’s not about *what* the system does (like generating a report) but *how* it’s secured and controlled.


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific action – modifying program details. It’s about *what* the system *does* – changing data.  It doesn’t specify a performance metric (like speed) or a constraint (like security). Therefore, it falls squarely into the category of a functional requirement.


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes *what* the system should do – add a new cohort based on specific criteria (start month and year). It’s a core function of the system related to managing student data. It doesn’t specify *how* it should be done (e.g., the user interface, the underlying algorithm) – that would be a non-functional requirement.


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on *performance* and *availability* – specifically, the speed at which an administrator can perform an action (deactivate an account) and the resulting impact on the customer’s access. It’s not about the *what* (deactivating an account) but *how quickly* and *reliably* it can be done.  Therefore, it falls under the category of non-functional requirements, which describe qualities like performance, reliability, security, and usability.


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific performance characteristic – the frequency with which the product checks for updates. This falls squarely into the category of non-functional requirements, which define *how* a system should behave, rather than *what* it should do. It’s about responsiveness and performance, not a specific feature or function.


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes *what* the system should do – automatically enter formulas for substitutionary ingredients. It’s a specific action the system needs to perform to fulfill a process.  It’s not about performance, security, or usability – those are non-functional requirements.


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a *performance* or *usability* characteristic of the system. It’s not about *what* the system does (a functional requirement), but rather *how well* it performs and is usable.
