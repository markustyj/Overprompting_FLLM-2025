**Classification: Operational/Technical**

Here’s a breakdown of why this requirement falls into the Operational/Technical category:

*   **Focus on System Interaction:** This requirement directly addresses how the RFS system interacts with another system (BDW). It’s about data transfer and integration.
*   **Specific Time Constraints:** The 3-hour timeframe and annual repetition highlight operational aspects – ensuring data is available when needed.
*   **Data Volume & Frequency:** The mention of 7 data files and annual loading indicates a recurring operational task.

**Key Characteristics aligning with Operational/Technical:**

*   **Process-Oriented:** It describes a specific process – loading data from BDW.
*   **Performance-Related:** The 3-hour timeframe emphasizes performance and efficiency.
*   **System Dependency:** It relies on the proper functioning of both the RFS and BDW systems.

**Would not be classified as:**

*   **Business Requirement:** It doesn’t directly address a business goal or strategy.
*   **User Interface Requirement:** It’s not about the look and feel of the system.

Do you want me to elaborate on any aspect of this classification, or perhaps provide a more detailed breakdown of the requirement’s components?
