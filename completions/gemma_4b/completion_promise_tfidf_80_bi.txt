*   **Quantifiable Metric:** It specifies a measurable aspect – “without any degradation of performance.”
*   **Impact on User Experience:** Performance requirements directly impact the user experience – if the system slows down or fails under load, users will be negatively affected.

Let’s break down the categories:

*   **Functional:** Describes *what* the system does.
*   **Non-Functional:** Describes *how* the system performs (e.g., performance, security, usability).

Therefore, this requirement falls squarely into the **Non-Functional (Performance)** category.


**Non-Functional Requirement (NFR)** – Specifically, a Security NFR.

**Reasoning:**

This requirement directly addresses the *how* of system access and security. It’s not about *what* the system does (a functional requirement), but rather *how* it’s accessed and controlled. It focuses on:

*   **Security:** Limiting access based on roles is a fundamental security principle.
*   **Access Control:** Defining roles and assigning permissions is a core aspect of access control.
*   **Governance:** It establishes a framework for managing user access within the RFS system.

**Key Characteristics of an NFR:**

*   It’s often expressed in terms of qualities like security, performance, reliability, or usability.
*   It’s typically measurable (though the metrics might be qualitative – e.g., “access should be secure”).

**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a future development effort – translating the product into new languages. It focuses on a timeline (5 days) and a process (configuration) rather than a core functional behavior of the product. It’s about *how* the product is delivered and supported, not *what* the product does.  It’s a maintenance and support-related requirement.


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a *duration* and *scope* of operation – how long the system is expected to be used and what it’s intended to do. These are characteristics of the system’s performance and longevity, rather than a specific feature or behavior. It’s about the system’s robustness and ability to sustain operations over time.

**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific action the system *must* perform – notifying users about changes. It’s a core function of the system, directly impacting user awareness and potentially workflow. It’s not a constraint on performance, security, or design; it’s a task the system needs to accomplish.


**Non-Functional Requirement (Performance)**

This requirement falls under the category of performance. It’s specifically related to the system’s ability to handle concurrent users and requests – in this case, streaming video. 

Here’s why:

*   **Quantifiable:** It specifies a concrete number (50) – a key characteristic of a non-functional requirement.
*   **Concerned with System Behavior:** It describes how the system *should* behave under load.
*   **Testable:** This requirement can be tested by simulating multiple users streaming simultaneously and monitoring the system’s performance (e.g., buffering, latency).


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific behavior of the system – what it *does* when certain conditions are met (no ratings exist). It’s not about *what* the system *does* in terms of core functionality, but rather how it handles a particular state.  Non-functional requirements (NFRs) typically deal with qualities like performance, reliability, usability, security, and constraints – this falls squarely into the category of system behavior under specific circumstances.


**Non-Functional** – Specifically, this falls under **Performance**. 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement directly addresses the speed and responsiveness of a system component (returning the audit report).  It’s about how quickly the system *performs* a task.  It’s not about the *what* (the content of the report) but the *how fast* it’s delivered.

**Non-Functional Requirement (Performance)**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement directly addresses the *speed* at which the system responds – specifically, the time it takes to perform a search and return the results.  “Performance” is the key category for requirements that focus on speed, responsiveness, and efficiency.  It’s not about *what* the system does (finding parts) but *how quickly* it does it.


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement deals with data maintenance, system performance, and data integrity – all core aspects of a system’s technical operation. It’s about ensuring the database remains accurate and efficient by removing outdated information.  It’s not a feature describing *what* the system does, but rather *how* it operates and maintains its data. 

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a system behavior – notifying users about changes to a policy. This falls under the category of *non-functional requirements* because it focuses on *how* the system performs (communication of changes) rather than *what* the system does (e.g., storing data, processing transactions).  It’s a quality attribute related to communication and user awareness.


**Non-Functional** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a process and a performance target (installation time and success rate). It’s about *how* the system operates and its reliability, rather than *what* the system does.  Specifically, it’s focused on the maintenance process and its efficiency.


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a metric – the percentage of customers comfortable with a process (streaming movies after 2 weeks). It’s a measure of user satisfaction and usability, which falls squarely within the realm of non-functional requirements. Non-functional requirements define *how* a system should behave, rather than *what* it should do. In this case, it’s about the user experience and perceived ease of use.


**Non-Functional** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a performance characteristic of the system – its ability to handle a certain number of concurrent users.  Non-functional requirements (often called “quality attributes”) define *how* a system should behave, rather than *what* it should do.  Capacity, performance, and scalability are all examples of non-functional requirements.


**Functional Requirement**

This requirement describes a specific action the system *must* perform – generating a printable summary of clinical site lab information. It dictates what data is included and the format of the output. 

Here’s why it’s classified as functional:

*   **Action-Oriented:** It specifies a clear action the system needs to take.
*   **Data-Driven:** It defines the data that needs to be displayed (labs, dates, times).
*   **Output-Focused:** It describes the desired output (a printable summary).

**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes *what* the system *does* – it displays an audit report. This directly relates to the system's functionality and how it interacts with the user.  It’s about a specific action the system performs, not a quality attribute like performance or usability.


**Non-Functional Requirement**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on a measurable outcome – the success rate of a specific task (following up on dispute cases) – after a defined action (completion of a training course). It’s about *how* the system performs, rather than *what* it does. It’s a performance metric that needs to be consistently achieved. 

Here's why it's not a functional requirement:

*   **Focus on Performance:** It’s about the *effectiveness* of the user (merchant services representatives) using the system.
*   **Measurable:** The 100% success rate is a quantifiable target.
*   **Training Dependent:** It’s tied to a specific training intervention.

**Functional Requirement**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement directly describes *what* the system must do – allow users to change details about a clinical site. It’s a core function of managing clinical placements, which is a key aspect of the system’s purpose.  It’s not a constraint on performance, security, or usability – those are non-functional requirements.


**Functional Requirement**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a core capability of the Disputes System – the ability to *view* existing cases. This directly relates to the system’s purpose: managing and tracking disputes. Viewing cases is a fundamental function, not a performance characteristic or a technical constraint. 

Here's a breakdown of why it's not the other classifications:

*   **Non-Functional Requirement:** It doesn't address aspects like performance, security, or usability.
*   **Data Requirement:** It’s not simply about *what* data is stored, but *what the system can do with* that data (view it).


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes *what* the system *does* – it combines data to generate a score. It’s a core function of the system, not a constraint on *how* it’s done.  It’s about the output and the data processing involved.


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a constraint on the system's availability – specifically, the times during which it *must* be operational. This falls squarely into the category of non-functional requirements, which define *how* a system should behave, rather than *what* it should do.  Availability and uptime are core aspects of non-functional requirements.


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a system behavior – how data is handled – rather than a specific feature or function. It’s about data persistence and retention, which falls under the umbrella of system characteristics like reliability, data management, and potentially security (depending on the context). It’s not a “do” statement (like “the system shall allow users to create a report”) but rather a constraint on how the system *must* operate.


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes *what* the system needs to do – it dictates a specific action (adding a class/section) within the system’s functionality. It’s about the system’s behavior, not its performance, usability, or other non-functional characteristics.


**Classification:** Operational/Technical

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific, measurable process – the loading of data from the BDW system into the RFS system. It focuses on:

*   **Process:** The loading of data.
*   **Frequency:** Daily (5 times a year)
*   **Data Volume:** 7 data files
*   **Timing:** Before the start of the budgeting process, specifically month-end data.

These elements clearly indicate a technical requirement related to system integration and data management – a core operational need for the RFS system. 

**Key Indicators:**

*   “Interface with the BDW environment” – highlights the integration aspect.
*   “Loaded within 3 hours” – sets a performance target.
*   “Test files” – indicates a verification/testing component.


Functional


**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, a **Performance Requirement**.

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on Performance:** This requirement directly addresses the speed and responsiveness of the system (response time).
*   **Quantifiable Metric:** It sets a specific target (2 seconds for 95%, 4% for the remainder) which is a key characteristic of a non-functional requirement.
*   **Impact on User Experience:**  It’s concerned with how the system *feels* to the user – whether it’s “fast enough to maintain the flow of the game.”

**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a feature – the ability to maintain lead data parameters within a system interface. This falls under the category of *non-functional* requirements because it focuses on *how* the system operates (the interface) rather than *what* the system does (e.g., generates reports, processes data). Non-functional requirements typically address qualities like usability, performance, security, and maintainability.


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes an operational characteristic of the system – how it handles data preservation and recovery. It’s not about *what* the system does (like creating a dispute) but *how* it performs its core function reliably. Backup and restore are crucial for system availability and data integrity, making it a non-functional aspect.


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes *what* the system *does* – it inserts leads. It’s a specific action and a core function of the system.  It doesn’t describe performance, security, usability, or any other non-functional characteristic. It’s about the system’s behavior.


**Non-Functional Requirement**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a system behavior – the logging of user changes. It’s not about *what* the system does (like displaying player stats or generating a CMA report), but rather *how* it operates and maintains its internal state. Logging user actions is a core aspect of system administration, security, and auditing – all hallmarks of a non-functional requirement.

**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a performance characteristic of the system – its ability to handle a specific load (10 users) during a defined timeframe (9am-5pm).  It’s about *how* the system performs, not *what* it does.  Non-functional requirements often deal with aspects like performance, scalability, reliability, security, and usability.


**Security Requirement**

This requirement falls squarely into the category of **Security Requirements**. It directly addresses the need to control access to the system and ensure that only authorized individuals can perform actions within it. 

Here’s why:

*   **Authentication:** Verifying the user’s identity (e.g., username/password).
*   **Authorization:** Determining what the authenticated user is permitted to do.

**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, this falls under **Usability** and **Learnability**.

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on User Experience:** The requirement directly addresses how easily a user can learn and use the system.
*   **Measurable Goal:** The “90% of users” metric provides a quantifiable target for assessing the system’s learnability.
*   **Not Core Functionality:** It’s not about *what* the system does (like processing data or sending notifications) but *how* a user interacts with it.

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Classification:** **Functional Requirement**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes *what* the system *must do* – format letter requests according to a specific system’s guidelines. It’s a concrete action the system needs to perform.  It’s not a constraint on *how* the system does it (e.g., performance, security), but rather a defined behavior. 

Here's why it doesn't fit other categories:

*   **Non-Functional:** It’s not a constraint on performance, security, usability, etc.
*   **Data Requirement:** It’s not about the *type* of data, but how data is processed.
*   **Interface Requirement:** While it involves an interface (the Print Letter Utility system), the core of the requirement is about the *output* of that interface.


**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, a **Performance Requirement**.

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on Performance:** This requirement directly addresses the speed and responsiveness of the system under a specific condition (a 56k connection).
*   **Measurable:** It sets a quantifiable target (6 seconds) and a success rate (90%).
*   **Contextual:** It’s tied to a particular environment (56k connection), making it relevant for testing and ensuring the system behaves as expected in that scenario.

Let me know if you’d like to classify another requirement!


Non-Functional


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a constraint on *who* can access information – a security restriction.  It’s not about *how* the system works (functional) but rather a quality attribute – specifically, **Security**.  It dictates a specific access control rule.


**Functional Requirement**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes *what* the system *must do*. It specifies a core function – the ability to change details about a program of study. This directly relates to the system’s intended purpose and how users will interact with it. It’s not about *how* the system does it, but rather the capability itself. 

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a *capability* of the system – the ability to add a cohort. It focuses on *how* the system should function (adding a cohort) rather than the system’s characteristics like performance, security, or usability. It’s a functional requirement, but leans more towards describing a process than a quality attribute.


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a performance characteristic of the system – the speed at which an administrator can deactivate a customer account. It’s a constraint on the system’s behavior, focusing on efficiency and speed. It’s not a feature describing *what* the system does, but *how* it performs a specific action. 

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Non-Functional** – Specifically, this falls under **Performance** or **Reliability**.

Here’s why:

*   **Frequency & Timing:** The requirement dictates a precise polling frequency (every second) and a maximum limit (1 second). This directly relates to how quickly the system responds and processes information – key aspects of performance.
*   **Reliability:** Ensuring the system checks for messages regularly is crucial for ensuring that the product doesn’t miss important updates or notifications.

It’s not a functional requirement (describing *what* the product does) but rather a constraint on *how* it does it.


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes *what* the system *does* – it automatically enters ingredient substitutions. It’s a specific action performed by a subsystem, directly relating to the system’s functionality.  It’s not a constraint (like performance) or a quality attribute (like usability).


**Non-Functional Requirement**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on *performance* and *usability*. It’s not about *what* the system does (scheduling classes and clinicals), but *how well* it’s done. The “2 out of 3” metric introduces a quantifiable measure of success (performance) and implies a level of reliability and usability. It’s testing the system’s ability to meet a specific standard of operation.
