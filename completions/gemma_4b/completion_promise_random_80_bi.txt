**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a technical dependency and a constraint on the system’s architecture. It specifies *how* the product must interact with a database, rather than *what* the product does or *how* it behaves. It’s a technical limitation that impacts the system’s design and implementation. 

Here's why it's not a functional requirement:

*   **Doesn't define a core feature:** It doesn't describe a specific user interaction or capability of the product.
*   **Focuses on integration:** It’s about the system’s technical infrastructure, not its core functionality.


**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, a **Usability** requirement.

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on how easy the product is to use. A standard navigation menu is a key element of usability, ensuring users can quickly and intuitively find what they need. It’s not a functional feature (like “the product shall record all the equipment that has been reserved”), but rather a characteristic of the user experience.


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a core action a user can perform within the system – identifying themselves as a player. This directly relates to the system’s functionality and how users interact with it. It’s not a constraint, performance metric, or aesthetic consideration; it’s a fundamental feature.


**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, a **Performance Requirement**.

Here’s why:

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific behavior of the system – what it *does* when certain conditions are met (no ratings defined). Non-functional requirements (NFRs) focus on *how* a system performs, rather than *what* it does. This falls squarely into the category of performance, usability, or data handling – all aspects of an NFR. 

Let's break down why it's not a functional requirement:

*   **Functional Requirements** typically describe core business processes or features (e.g., "The system shall allow users to create a new account"). This requirement doesn't relate to a core business function.
*   It’s a response to a state (no ratings) and defines the system’s behavior in that state.


**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, a **Performance Requirement**.

Here’s why:
