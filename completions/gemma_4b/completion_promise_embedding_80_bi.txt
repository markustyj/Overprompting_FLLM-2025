*   **Observable:** The result (the visual representation) is something that can be observed and verified.

Let me know if you’d like me to classify another requirement!


**Non-Functional Requirement**

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on Technology:** This requirement specifies a technical component (a database management system) that the product *must* use. It’s not about a specific feature or user interaction.
*   **Implementation Detail:** It’s a detail of *how* the product will store and manage data, rather than *what* the product does.
*   **Constraints:** It imposes a technical constraint on the development team.

**Therefore, it’s a Non-Functional Requirement (NFR) – specifically, a technical NFR related to the system’s architecture and data management.**


**Non-Functional** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a characteristic of the user interface – its usability and familiarity. It’s about *how* the product feels and is easy to use, which falls squarely within the realm of usability and user experience, a core aspect of non-functional requirements. It’s not about *what* the product does, but *how* it’s presented and navigated.


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a core action the user can perform within the system – identifying themselves as a player. This directly relates to the system's functionality and how a user interacts with it. It’s not a quality attribute (like performance or security) but a fundamental feature.


**Performance**

Here’s why:

*   **Quantifiable Metric:** It specifies a concrete number (10,000 and 20,000 transactions) – a key characteristic of performance requirements.
*   **Time-Based:** It includes a timeframe (within two years, and then by Release 2) – crucial for measuring performance over time.
*   **Scalability:** The requirement to increase to 20,000 transactions indicates a need for the system to scale and handle increasing loads.

Let me know if you’d like to classify another requirement!

**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, a **Performance Requirement** and a **Service Level Agreement (SLA)**.

Here’s the breakdown:

*   **Performance Requirement:** The core of the requirement – “completed in 5 minutes” – directly addresses the speed and efficiency of a process (lead cycle time).
*   **Service Level Agreement (SLA):** The “90% of lead volume” and “3 minutes for 99% of lead volume” portions define a specific target level of service. It sets a measurable performance benchmark.

**Why it’s Non-Functional:** This requirement doesn’t describe *what* the system *does* (like a functional requirement) but rather *how well* it performs. It’s about speed and efficiency, not the core functionality.


**Non-Functional Requirement (Usability)**

Here’s the breakdown of why it’s classified as a Non-Functional Requirement, specifically within the category of Usability:

*   **Focus on Quality Attribute:** This requirement directly addresses a *quality attribute* of the system – usability. It’s not about what the system *does* (functionality), but how easy it is to *use*.
*   **Measurable:** The requirement includes a measurable criterion – “90% of beta testers must report that the interface is adequately simple.” This is key to non-functional requirements; they need to be testable.
*   **Impact on User Experience:**  A simple interface is crucial for user satisfaction and efficiency.

**Therefore, it’s a Non-Functional Requirement (specifically, a Usability Requirement).**


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific data display function – pulling information from two distinct applications. This clearly falls under the category of a system’s core functionality – presenting data to the user. It’s not about performance, availability, or user experience (which would be Non-Functional requirements).


**Non-Functional Requirement (NFR)** – Specifically, this falls under **Usability** and **Internationalization**.

**Non-Functional Requirement**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a system capability – the ability to diagnose and resolve errors. It focuses on *how* the system performs (error tracking and resolution) rather than *what* the system does (e.g., processes transactions).  The inclusion of a success rate (99%) further emphasizes this aspect – it’s a performance metric. 

Here's why it's not a functional requirement:

*   **Focus on Process:** It describes a support mechanism, not a core feature of the product.
*   **Metric-Driven:** The 99% success rate is a key performance indicator (KPI) rather than a description of a specific function.


**Classification: Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific *action* the product takes – analyzing a defensive grid to determine a shot’s outcome. It’s a core function of the product and directly relates to how it operates within the game’s mechanics. It’s not a usability concern (like “the interface is easy to understand”) or a performance constraint (like “response time must be under 2 seconds”). It’s a fundamental piece of the product’s logic.



**Non-Functional Requirement (Performance)**

Here’s the breakdown of why it’s classified as a performance requirement:

*   **Focus on Speed & Response Time:** The requirement explicitly addresses “speed” and “response time,” which are core aspects of performance.
*   **Quantifiable Metric:** It sets a specific target (2 seconds 90% of the time) and a tolerance (10 seconds for 10% of the time). This makes it measurable.
*   **Impact on User Experience:** Slow response times directly impact the user experience, making the system feel sluggish and frustrating.

**Non-Functional Requirement (NFR) - Usability & User Satisfaction**

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on User Experience:** This requirement directly addresses how users *feel* about the system – their comfort level.
*   **Measurable:** It specifies a quantifiable metric – 95% comfort level.
*   **Time-Dependent:** The survey is conducted *after* a month of use, indicating a need to assess long-term satisfaction.

**Key Characteristics of an NFR:**

*   Often qualitative (describes *how* something should be)
*   Difficult to directly test or verify
*   Impacts user experience and overall system success

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this classification?


**Non-Functional Requirement**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a display feature – showing existing ratings. It’s about *how* the system *should* behave, focusing on the user interface and data presentation, rather than the core functionality or business logic of the system. It’s a technical requirement related to the user experience.


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on User Experience:** This requirement centers on the *experience* a user (likely a potential customer) has when interacting with the website. It’s about design and aesthetics to resonate with a broad audience.
*   **Not Core Functionality:** It doesn’t describe *what* the website *does* (e.g., sells products, provides information).
*   **Measurable (Potentially):** While “appeal” is subjective, it could be tied to metrics like user engagement, conversion rates, or user feedback from different African countries.

**Therefore, it’s a Non-Functional Requirement (NFR) – specifically, a usability or design NFR.**


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific action a user can take within the system – purchasing a pre-paid card with different denominations and payment methods. This directly relates to the system’s core functionality and how users interact with it to achieve a desired outcome. It’s not a constraint or performance metric, but rather a feature that defines what the system *does*.


**Non-Functional Requirement (NFR) - Maintainability/Operational Efficiency**

Here’s the breakdown of why:

*   **Focus on Ease of Use & Automation:** The requirement emphasizes “easily integrate” and “little to no support.” This directly relates to how easily the system can be updated and maintained.
*   **Operational Efficiency:** It’s about minimizing the effort needed to keep the system current and functional.
*   **Not Core Functionality:** It’s not about *what* the product does (mapping) but *how* it’s maintained.

**Key Characteristics of an NFR:**

*   Often expressed as qualities or characteristics (e.g., ease of use, performance, reliability).
*   Typically measurable (though the metrics might be qualitative – “easy” doesn’t have a precise number).
*   Impacts the operational aspects of the system.

**Non-Functional Requirement (Performance)**

This requirement falls squarely into the category of performance requirements. It specifically addresses the system’s ability to handle a certain load (350 concurrent users) without negatively impacting its functionality (no degradation of performance). 

Here's a breakdown of why:

*   **Focus on System Behavior:** It’s not about *what* the system does, but *how* it performs under a specific load.
*   **Measurable:** “No degradation of performance” implies a quantifiable metric (e.g., response times, throughput) that would need to be defined and tested.

Would you like me to elaborate on how this requirement might be further refined or tested?


**Non-Functional Requirement (NFR) – Security & Access Control**

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on System Behavior:** This requirement describes *how* the system should behave – specifically, how access control is managed. It’s not about a specific feature or data element.
*   **Quality Attribute:** It directly relates to a key quality attribute of software: **Security**.  It’s about protecting data and functionality by controlling who can access it.
*   **Constraints:** It imposes constraints on the system’s design and implementation – the hierarchical role-based access control.

**Key Characteristics of an NFR:**

*   Often expressed in terms of qualities like security, performance, usability, reliability, etc.
*   Describes *what* the system should achieve, not *how* to achieve it (that’s a functional requirement).
*   Typically measurable (though the metrics might be qualitative – e.g., “the system must be secure”).

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this classification?

*   **Core Capability:** Storing data is a fundamental aspect of a system managing room resources.

Let me know if you’d like to classify another requirement!


**Non-Functional Requirement (NFR) - Maintainability/Adaptability**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on the product’s ability to be adapted and extended to new markets. It’s not about core functionality, performance, or security – it’s about the *process* of adapting the product to different languages.  The timeframe (5 days) adds a specific, measurable constraint, which is a key characteristic of NFRs. 

Here's a breakdown of why it’s not other types of requirements:

*   **Not a Functional Requirement:** It doesn’t describe *what* the product does, only *how* it can be modified.
*   **Not a Performance Requirement:** It doesn’t specify speed or responsiveness.
*   **Not a Security Requirement:** It doesn’t address vulnerabilities or access controls.

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Non-Functional Requirement**

*   **Not a Specific Function:** It doesn’t describe *what* the system *does* (e.g., scheduling a class). It describes *how well* it does it over time.

Let me know if you’d like me to classify another requirement!


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific action the system *must* perform – notifying users about changes to class information. It’s a defined behavior of the system, directly impacting how users interact with it.  It’s not a quality attribute like performance or security, but rather a core function.


**Non-Functional Requirement (Performance)**

This requirement falls under the category of performance requirements. It specifically addresses the system’s ability to handle concurrent users and, in this case, the number of simultaneous streaming connections. 

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on Capacity:** It’s not about *what* the system does (like processing a dispute) but *how well* it performs under load.
*   **Measurable:** “50 simultaneous streaming connections” is a quantifiable metric.

Would you like me to elaborate on why this is a non-functional requirement, or perhaps provide an example of other types of non-functional requirements?


**Classification:** **Data Validation / Error Handling**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement directly addresses what happens when the system encounters a situation where data is missing or invalid (in this case, no ratings have been defined). It’s a core aspect of data validation – ensuring the system handles incomplete or unexpected data gracefully, rather than crashing or producing incorrect results.  It’s a crucial part of ensuring data integrity. 

Here's why other classifications aren't as suitable:

*   **UI/UX:** While it impacts the user interface, the primary goal is data handling, not just visual presentation.
*   **Functional Requirement:** It’s a specific function of the system, but it’s tied to how the system *responds* to a condition, not the core functionality itself.


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on *performance* – specifically, the speed at which a report is delivered.  Performance characteristics (like response time) are a core element of non-functional requirements (often referred to as “NFRs”).  It’s not about *what* the report contains, but *how quickly* it’s delivered.


**Non-Functional Requirement (Performance)**

This requirement falls squarely into the category of performance. It specifically addresses the speed and responsiveness of a system component – the recycled parts search.  It’s a key metric for user experience and system efficiency.


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement deals with data maintenance, system performance, and data integrity – all core aspects of a system’s technical operation. It’s not a feature describing *what* the system *does* (like “allow users to update billing information”), but rather *how* the system *should behave* to maintain its health and accuracy. Specifically, it’s a data governance requirement. 

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a system behavior – notifying users about changes to a policy. This falls under the category of system characteristics like reliability, maintainability, and usability. It’s not a specific feature or function, but rather a quality attribute of the system. 

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, a **Service Level Agreement (SLA)** related to maintenance.

Here’s why:

*   **Quantitative Metric:** The “70%” provides a measurable target for user comfort.
*   **Doesn’t Define Functionality:** It doesn’t describe *how* the website should work, just that users should feel comfortable with the purchase process.

Would you like me to categorize any other requirements you provide?


**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, this falls under **Performance** or **Scalability**. 

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on Capacity:** The requirement directly addresses the system’s ability to handle a specific number of concurrent users. This is a key aspect of system performance.
*   **Not a Feature:** It’s not about a specific feature or functionality; it’s about the system’s capacity to operate effectively under load.

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific output – a printable summary – based on data within the system. It dictates *what* the system should do (generate a report) and *what* information should be included in that report. This aligns with the core function of a system – processing data and producing results. 

Here's why it's not other classifications:

*   **Non-Functional:** It doesn't address qualities like performance, security, or usability.
*   **Data:** It’s a requirement for *how* data is presented, not the data itself.


**Non-Functional Requirement (Performance)**

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on Speed:** The requirement explicitly states a time constraint – “in under 5 seconds.” This directly relates to performance.
*   **User Experience:**  Fast login is a key element of a good user experience.

This requirement describes a specific action the system must perform – allowing users to add clinical classes to a sequence. It’s about *what* the system does. 

Here’s why it’s classified as functional:

*   **Action-Oriented:** It specifies a user action (adding a class).
*   **System Behavior:** It defines a core system behavior – the ability to build a class sequence.

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, a **Performance/Data Loading Requirement**.

Here’s the breakdown of why:

*   **Focus on Process & Timing:** This requirement isn’t about *what* the RFS system *does* (like creating a ticket or accessing data). It’s about *how* it loads data from the BDW environment – the specific timeframe (3 hours), frequency (5 times/year), and data volume (7 files) are all performance-related.
*   **Measurable Metric:** The 3-hour timeframe provides a measurable metric for assessing the system’s performance.
*   **Impact on System Behavior:**  This requirement directly impacts the system’s behavior – how quickly it can prepare for the budgeting process.

Here’s why it’s classified as functional:

*   **Action-Oriented:** It describes a specific action – maintaining data parameters.
*   **Describes Behavior:** It defines how the system *should* behave when dealing with lead data.

Let me know if you’d like me to classify another requirement!


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a characteristic of the system – its ability to automatically back up and restore data. This falls under the category of *non-functional requirements* because it focuses on *how* the system performs (its reliability, data protection capabilities) rather than *what* it does (e.g., scheduling classes, managing leads). 

Here's why it's not functional:

*   **Focus on Behavior:** It’s about the system’s behavior (automatic backup and restore) rather than a specific feature or task.
*   **Quality Attribute:** It’s a quality attribute related to reliability, availability, and disaster recovery.


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific action the system *must* perform – inserting leads. It’s a core function of the system, directly related to its purpose (presumably lead management).  It’s not a constraint on performance, security, or usability – those would be non-functional requirements.


**Classification:** Operational/Data Integrity

**Reasoning:**

This requirement falls squarely into the category of operational and data integrity. Here’s why:

*   **Operational:** It describes a process – the logging of user additions and access changes – that’s a core operational activity for the system.
*   **Data Integrity:** Accurate tracking of user access is crucial for maintaining data integrity. It’s essential for auditing, security, and ensuring that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive information.

**Other potential classifications (and why they’re less accurate):**

*   **Security:** While security is *affected* by this requirement, it’s not the primary focus. The requirement itself is about record-keeping, not directly about preventing unauthorized access.
*   **Reporting:** It’s a component of reporting, but the core purpose is to maintain an audit trail.

Would you like me to classify another requirement from the list?


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific action the system *must* perform – logging sales data. This directly relates to the core functionality of the system (tracking sales) and is not a quality attribute like performance or usability. It’s about what the system *does*.


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a performance characteristic of the system – its ability to handle a specific load (10 users) during a defined period (9am-5pm). This falls squarely into the category of non-functional requirements, which focus on *how* the system performs, rather than *what* it does. 

Here's why it's not a functional requirement:

*   **Functional requirements** typically describe the core features and actions the system must perform (e.g., "The system shall allow users to schedule appointments"). 

Let me know if you’d like me to classify another requirement!

Here's why it's not other classifications:

*   **Functional Requirement:** It doesn’t describe *what* the system *does* (e.g., scheduling, reporting).
*   **Usability Requirement:** It doesn’t relate to ease of use or user experience.


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific action a user can perform within the system – modifying details of a Program of Study. It’s about *what* the system allows the user to do.  It’s not about performance characteristics, security, or usability – those are non-functional requirements.


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific action that users (Program Administrators and Nursing Staff) can perform within the system – adding a new cohort. It dictates *what* the system must allow users to do.  It’s not about performance, security, or any other non-functional aspect. It’s a core capability.


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a performance characteristic of the system – specifically, the speed at which an administrator can deactivate a customer account. It’s about *how* the system performs, not *what* it does.  It’s a measurable constraint on the system’s behavior. 

Here’s why it doesn’t fit into the other categories:

*   **Functional:** It doesn’t describe a specific feature or function of the system (like “allow users to create a chargeback request”).
*   **Usability:** While speed contributes to usability, this requirement is focused on a technical performance metric.


**Non-Functional** – Specifically, this falls under **Performance** or **Responsiveness**. 

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on Speed:** The requirement explicitly dictates a polling frequency (every second). This directly relates to how quickly the system responds to changes or updates.
*   **System Behavior:** It describes a characteristic of the system’s behavior – how often it checks for new information.
