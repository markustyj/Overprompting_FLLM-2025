Based on the provided requirement – “The leads washing functionality will use the parameters supplied by corporate and schools to score part of the lead.” – the classification is **Maintainability**.

Here’s why:

*   **Maintainability** focuses on the ease with which the system can be modified, updated, and adapted to changing needs. This requirement directly addresses how the system’s core logic (scoring leads) is influenced by external data (parameters from corporate and schools). It highlights the need for a flexible system that can accommodate updates and changes in these parameters.

Let's look at why other classifications are less suitable:
