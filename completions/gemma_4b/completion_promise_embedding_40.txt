**Maintainability**

Here’s the breakdown of why:

*   **Data Loading & Integration:** The core of this requirement is about how the RFS system interacts with the BDW environment – specifically, the process of loading data.
*   **Efficiency & Timeliness:** The 3-hour timeframe and the repeated loading of test files highlight a need for a robust and efficient data integration process.
*   **Regularity:** The annual nature of the data load and the repeated testing emphasize the need for maintainable processes.
