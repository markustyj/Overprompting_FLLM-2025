Here’s why it’s classified as functional:

*   **Action-Oriented:** It specifies what the system *does* (displays seating, allows booking).
*   **Measurable:** The “available seats” and “desired number of seats” aspects allow for verification – does the system correctly show availability and allow the user to select the appropriate quantity?

**Would also be considered a User Interface (UI) requirement** as it directly relates to how the user interacts with the system.


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on Process & Control:** This requirement isn’t about *what* the user does (like adding a task or selecting a product). It’s about a *process* – the need for approval – and the system’s role in enforcing that process.
*   **System Behavior:** It dictates how the system *must* behave – it needs to facilitate and track this approval process.
*   **Quality Attribute:** This falls under quality attributes like security, compliance, and governance.

Let’s break it down further:

*   **Not a Functional Requirement:** A functional requirement describes a specific action a user can perform (e.g., “User can add a new item to the shopping cart”).
*   **Related to Security/Compliance:** It’s directly related to ensuring that assets aren’t being moved without proper authorization.


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a core function of the application – taking user input and triggering a specific action within the interface. This falls squarely within the realm of what the system *does*, rather than how it *is* (e.g., performance, security, usability).  It’s a fundamental operational requirement.



**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

It’s a technical detail related to the hardware and doesn’t relate to the system’s functionality, performance, or user experience. It’s a constraint on the system’s design.


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement directly relates to a specific feature or workflow within the system – the ability to select a processing speed (tatkaal vs. normal). This clearly defines a functional aspect of the system’s operation. 

It’s not a non-functional requirement (like performance or security) because it describes *what* the user can do, not *how well* it’s done.


**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, a constraint on data input.

**Reasoning:**

This requirement dictates *how* a user *must* input data. It’s not about the functionality itself (e.g., “User must be able to enter a Client name”), but rather a technical limitation on the acceptable format of that input.  These types of constraints are typically categorized as non-functional because they relate to the system’s behavior under specific conditions (data validation). 

Here's why it's not a functional requirement:

*   **Focus on Constraint:** It’s not describing *what* the system *does* with the Client name, but *how* the user is allowed to enter it.
*   **Technical Specification:** It’s a technical rule for data validation.


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Specifically: Performance/Scalability** 

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on System Behavior:** This requirement describes *how* the system should behave under increasing load (a growing user base). It’s not about a specific feature or functionality.
*   **Performance Aspect:** Scalability directly relates to the system’s ability to handle increased demand – a core performance characteristic.

This falls squarely into the category of non-functional requirements, which focus on *how* the system behaves rather than *what* it does. 

Here's why it's not a functional requirement:

*   **Doesn't define a core feature:** It doesn't describe a new capability or service the system provides.
*   **Addresses an exception:** It’s a contingency plan for a situation where the normal data acquisition process isn't working.


**Functional Requirement**

This requirement clearly describes a specific action the system must perform – generating and displaying a list of sites based on proximity and sorting. It dictates the *what* the system needs to do. 

**Reasoning:**

*   **Action-Oriented:** It specifies a clear action: "provide a list."
*   **Specific Criteria:** It outlines the criteria for the list (nearest sites, sorted alphabetically).
*   **Output Defined:** It describes the expected output – a list with specific characteristics.

**Non-Functional Requirement**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a *technical capability* of the system – the ability to recover deleted data. It’s not about *what* the system does for the user (e.g., displaying data), but rather *how* it’s implemented and accessed.  Specifically, the use of the command-line interface highlights a technical detail of the system’s operation, making it a non-functional requirement. It’s concerned with the system’s internal workings and accessibility for administrators/technical users.


**Functional Requirement**

This requirement clearly describes a specific action a user can perform within the system – submitting ratings based on an audit report. It dictates *what* the user can do. 

Here's why it's classified as functional:

*   **Action-Oriented:** It specifies a concrete task.
*   **System Impact:** It directly affects the system's data and functionality (recording ratings).

**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a core function of the system – allowing users to modify their personal information and preferences. This directly relates to how the system operates and what users can *do* with it. It’s not a constraint (non-functional) or a quality attribute (like performance or security).
