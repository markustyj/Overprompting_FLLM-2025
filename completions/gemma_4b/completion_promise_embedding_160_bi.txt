Here’s why it’s classified as functional:

*   **Action-Oriented:** It specifies a clear action: adding students.
*   **Outcome-Driven:** It defines the result of that action: eligibility for the program of study.

Let me know if you’d like me to classify another requirement!


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a constraint on *how* the product operates – specifically, limiting access to a feature (advertising empty time slots) based on a role (supervisor). This falls squarely into the category of non-functional requirements, which define *qualities* of the system, such as security, performance, and access control. It’s not about *what* the product does (e.g., scheduling meetings) but *how* it’s controlled.


**Non-Functional Requirement**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a system *capability* – the ability to generate a report. It focuses on *how* the system performs (displaying a report) rather than *what* the system does (e.g., managing student enrollment).  It’s about performance and functionality, not a specific feature or data element.  It’s also related to a user’s planning needs, which falls under the umbrella of system usability and support.


**Functional Requirement**

This requirement describes *what* the system needs to do – it dictates a specific action the user (the adjuster) can take within the system. It’s about a core process and capability. 

Here’s why it’s classified as functional:

*   **Action-Oriented:** It specifies a user action – overriding a preferred facility.
*   **Process-Related:** It’s part of the core workflow of estimating repairs.

Would you like me to elaborate on why this is a functional requirement, or perhaps provide an example of a non-functional requirement for comparison?


**Usability & User Satisfaction** 

This requirement falls squarely into the category of **Usability & User Satisfaction**. 

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on User Behavior:** It’s not about a technical feature or performance metric. It’s directly measuring how users *interact* with the product – specifically, whether they continue to use it regularly.
*   **Subjective Measurement:** The “want to use it” aspect is inherently subjective, relying on user feedback (the 80% survey result).
*   **Key Performance Indicator (KPI):** This type of requirement is often used to define a key performance indicator for the product’s success. 

Would you like me to classify any other requirements you provide?


**Non-Functional Requirement**

**Non-Functional Requirement** 

This requirement falls squarely into the category of non-functional requirements. It describes a *quality* of the system – specifically, the availability and on-demand nature of the streaming service. It’s not about *what* the system does (like displaying movie details), but *how* it performs that function (on-demand streaming). 

Would you like me to elaborate on why this is a non-functional requirement, or perhaps provide an example of other types of non-functional requirements?


Functional


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a quality attribute of the product – its visual appearance and consistency.  It’s not about *what* the product does (a functional requirement) but *how* it looks and feels.  These types of requirements relate to usability, aesthetics, and overall user experience, which are core aspects of non-functional requirements.


Here’s a classification of the requirement: “The product shall be easy for customers with novice skills on the Internet to purchase and watch streaming movies. Customers should be able to purchase and watch a pre-determined movie in under 3 minutes.”

**Primary Category:** **Functional** – This requirement directly describes *what* the product *does* – it allows users to purchase and stream movies.

**Secondary Categories:**

*   **Usability:** This is a key aspect, as it specifies “easy for customers with novice skills.”
*   **Performance:** The “under 3 minutes” timeframe is a performance metric.
*   **User Experience (UX):**  The ease of use is central to the UX.

**Reasoning:**

The core of the requirement is about the *functionality* of the streaming movie service. While usability and performance are important factors, they are all tied to the fundamental action of purchasing and watching a movie.

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Non-Functional Requirement (Performance)**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement directly addresses *how quickly* the system performs a specific task – finding a repair facility.  It’s a measurable performance characteristic (8 seconds) and falls squarely within the category of non-functional requirements, specifically focusing on speed and responsiveness. 

Here's a breakdown of why it's not a functional requirement:

*   **Functional Requirements** describe *what* the system does (e.g., "The system shall allow users to submit a repair request"). This requirement doesn't describe a specific action or function.
*   **Performance Requirements** are about the speed, efficiency, and responsiveness of the system.


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific *how* – how the system should present data (events in a graph). It’s about the system’s behavior and output, rather than a feature or functionality itself. It’s related to the user interface and data visualization, which are core aspects of system performance and usability.

It’s not a core functional requirement (like “the product must allow users to schedule meetings”) but rather a design element or aesthetic enhancement. It falls under the category of “look and feel” or “user experience,” which are typically considered non-functional requirements. 

Would you like me to classify another requirement from the list?


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific *behavior* of the system – how it communicates the outcome of a game. It’s about what the system *does*, not a constraint on its performance, security, or how it’s built.  It’s a core part of the game’s functionality.



**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes the *environment* in which the system must operate – a specific type of office setting (a nursing department at a university). Non-functional requirements typically address qualities like performance, reliability, usability, security, and operational environment. This requirement falls squarely into the operational environment category – it’s about where the system *must* function, not what it *does*.


**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, this falls under **Performance** and potentially **Usability**.

Here’s why:

*   **Performance:** The ability to pause and resume a data refresh directly impacts the system’s responsiveness and efficiency. It’s a mechanism to manage the load and potentially avoid overwhelming the system.
*   **Usability:** It provides a user-controlled mechanism, giving the user more control over the system’s operation.

Would you like me to classify another requirement from the list?


**Classification:** **Business Requirement / User Story**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific benefit or feature desired by a user (the owner). It’s not a technical specification (like “the system must support X protocol”) or a non-functional requirement (like “the system must be available 99.9% of the time”). Instead, it’s a statement of what a user *should* be able to do. 

It’s a key element of understanding the overall value proposition of the system. 

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a *characteristic* of the system – how it *operates* (real-time responses, user interface). It’s not a specific feature or functionality, but rather a quality or performance aspect. It’s about *how* the system should behave, not *what* it should do. 

Here's why it's not a functional requirement:

It’s about maintaining data and user context, which falls under the umbrella of system performance, usability, and overall user experience. It’s not a tangible component or a specific task. 

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific *function* the product must perform – providing portals and facilitating ad-hoc reporting and KPI analysis. It’s about *what* the system *does*, not how it does it (e.g., performance, security, or user interface).  It’s a core feature request.


**Non-Functional Requirement**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on *how* the product performs and its adaptability to different environments. It’s about technical feasibility, ease of integration, and user experience – all hallmarks of a non-functional requirement. Specifically, it’s about:

*   **Performance/Usability:** The ability for users (end-users) to easily integrate with different systems.
*   **Maintainability:** The product’s adaptability suggests a need for flexibility and ease of modification.
*   **Technical Feasibility:** The statement about not changing the product’s code highlights a key technical consideration.

Let's break down why it’s *not* a functional requirement:

*   **Functional requirements** describe *what* the system *does* – the core features and capabilities. This requirement describes *how* the system is built to achieve those features.


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes *what* the system *does*. It details the steps a user takes to initiate a chargeback, the information required, and the outcome (a printed notification). It’s focused on the system’s behavior and functionality, not its qualities like performance, security, or usability. 

Here's why it's not other classifications:

*   **Non-Functional:** It doesn't describe qualities like performance, security, or usability.
*   **Data:** It’s not simply about the data itself, but the process of using the data to trigger an action.


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a usability characteristic of the product – how easily it can be learned.  Usability is a key aspect of non-functional requirements, focusing on qualities like ease of use, learnability, and user satisfaction. It’s not a functional feature that *does* something, but rather a characteristic of *how* the system performs.


**Functional**

Let me know if you’d like me to classify another requirement!


**Non-Functional** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a security and data isolation constraint. It’s about *how* the system *should* behave – specifically, preventing unauthorized access to data. This falls squarely into the realm of non-functional requirements, which focus on qualities like security, performance, and reliability, rather than the specific features or functionality of the system. 

Here's why it's not functional:

*   **Not a Feature:** It doesn't describe a specific action or feature the system *does*.
*   **Security Concern:** It’s a security requirement – ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a design constraint – the product *must* adhere to a specific visual style.  Non-functional requirements (NFRs) typically deal with qualities of the system, such as performance, security, usability, or maintainability.  “Compliance with a corporate color scheme” directly relates to the overall look and feel of the product, which falls under the category of usability and aesthetic design – both NFRs.


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Specifically, it’s a Performance Requirement.** 

Here’s why:

*   **Defines a Constraint:** It sets a specific limit or boundary for a system behavior (the search radius).
*   **Impacts Usability/Functionality:**  If the radius were outside this range, the system wouldn’t function correctly – it wouldn’t be able to perform the search as intended. 

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Functional Requirement**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes *what* the system *must do* – it dictates a specific output (a printable log summary). It’s not about *how* it’s done, but rather the functionality it provides.  Displaying a log is a core function of a system for tracking and auditing activities.


**Non-Functional Requirement (Performance/Stability)**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement directly relates to the *speed* at which the system responds and operates – specifically, the time it takes to update the website. This falls squarely within the category of performance and stability requirements. It’s not a feature (like “allow customers to add reviews”) but rather a constraint on how quickly the system must function.


**Non-Functional Requirement (Performance)**

This requirement falls squarely into the category of performance. It’s specifically addressing the speed and efficiency with which the product handles messages – a key aspect of system performance. 

Here's why:

*   **Focus on Speed:** The core of the requirement is the "2-second processing time."
*   **Measurable:** It sets a specific, quantifiable target (2 seconds).
*   **Impact:**  Performance requirements like this directly impact user experience and system stability.


**Non-Functional** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a quality of the system – its ability to handle errors and prevent data corruption.  It’s not about *what* the system does (like displaying events or initiating disputes), but rather *how well* it performs under adverse conditions.  These types of requirements relate to reliability, robustness, and data integrity – all core aspects of non-functional requirements.


**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, a **Performance Requirement** and a **Reliability Requirement**.

Here’s the breakdown:

*   **Performance:** The requirement focuses on the *speed* and *effectiveness* of the Error Tracking Services – aiming for a 99% resolution rate. This directly relates to system performance.
*   **Reliability:** The 99% resolution rate indicates a desired level of reliability for the system’s ability to identify and fix errors.

**Why it’s not a Functional Requirement:** Functional requirements describe *what* the system *does* (e.g., “The system shall allow users to submit claims”). This requirement describes *how well* the system performs a specific function (error tracking).


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific action the product *must* perform – analyzing a defensive grid to determine a hit or miss. This directly relates to the core functionality of the product (presumably a game or simulation). It’s not a constraint on performance, usability, or any other non-functional aspect.


**Non-Functional Requirement (Performance)**

This requirement falls squarely into the category of performance requirements. It specifically addresses the speed and responsiveness of the product interface, setting measurable targets for response times. 

Here's a breakdown of why it's classified this way:

*   **Focus on System Behavior:** It’s not about *what* the product does, but *how quickly* it does it.
*   **Measurable Criteria:** It defines specific metrics (2 seconds 90% of the time, 10 seconds 10% of the time) that can be used to test and verify the requirement.
*   **Impact on User Experience:** Slow response times directly impact user experience, so it’s a critical consideration.


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a desired outcome – customer satisfaction – and a metric to measure it (95% comfort level). It’s not a specific feature or behavior of the system, but rather a target state. It’s concerned with *how* the system performs and the user experience it provides, making it a non-functional requirement. 

Here's why it doesn't fit other categories:

*   **Functional:** It doesn't specify *what* the system *does* (e.g., process transactions, manage accounts).
*   **Performance:** While it relates to user experience, it’s not a quantifiable performance metric like response time.


**Functional Requirement**

This requirement describes what the system *does* – it displays information to the user. This falls squarely into the category of a functional requirement, as it dictates a specific output or behavior of the system. 

Let's break down why:

*   **Actionable:** It specifies a task the system must perform (display ratings).
*   **Observable:** The outcome (display of ratings) is something that can be observed and verified.

**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a desired *quality* of the website – its appeal to a broader audience. It’s not about a specific feature or functionality, but rather about the overall user experience and design.  It’s a characteristic of the system, rather than a specific action it must perform. 

Here's why it's not another category:

*   **Functional Requirement:** It doesn't specify *what* the website *does*.
*   **Performance Requirement:** While appeal could relate to speed, this is more about design and cultural relevance.


**Functional Requirement:**

This requirement clearly describes a specific action a user can perform within the system – purchasing pre-paid cards. It dictates the available denominations and payment methods. 

**Reasoning:**

*   **Action-Oriented:** It specifies *what* the system must do – allow purchasing.
*   **Defines Capabilities:** It outlines the specific features related to this action (card values and payment options).

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Classification:** **Operational/Technical**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement falls squarely into the operational and technical domain. It describes a specific functionality – integrating new building maps – and outlines the expected ease of implementation with minimal support. 

Here’s a breakdown of why it’s categorized this way:

*   **Functionality:** It details a core feature of the product.
*   **Technical Detail:** It specifies the desired level of ease of integration, implying technical considerations around data formats, system compatibility, and potentially API integration.
*   **Operational Impact:** It touches on the operational efficiency – minimizing the need for support staff – which is a key operational concern.

**Other potential classifications (and why they’re less suitable):**

*   **Business Requirement:** While integration is important for business operations, the core of the requirement is about the *technical* process of integration.
*   **User Interface:** It’s related to the UI, but the focus is on the *technical* ability to integrate, not just the visual appearance.

**Non-Functional Requirement (Performance)**

**Justification:**

This requirement directly addresses the *performance* of the system under a specific load (350 concurrent users). It’s concerned with how the system *behaves* – specifically, whether it maintains acceptable speed and responsiveness under that load.  It’s not about *what* the system does (like data storage or user interface), but rather *how well* it performs.


**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, a **Security Requirement** and a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Requirement**.

Here’s why:

*   **Non-Functional:** This describes a characteristic of the system – how it *behaves* – rather than a specific feature or function.
*   **Security Requirement:** It directly addresses the security of the system by controlling who can access what.
*   **RBAC Requirement:** It explicitly states the system will use role-based access control, a common security practice.

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this classification?


Non-Functional


**Non-Functional Requirement (NFR) – Maintainability/Adaptability**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a system characteristic – the ability to adapt to new markets and languages. It’s not about *what* the system does (like a functional requirement), but *how* it’s designed to be updated and expanded. Specifically, it focuses on:

*   **Flexibility:** The system needs to be adaptable to different languages.
*   **Time Constraint:** The 5-day limit adds a key performance indicator (KPI) for this adaptation process.

**Key Characteristics of an NFR:**

*   **Quality Attribute:** This falls squarely into the category of “Maintainability” or “Adaptability” of a system.
*   **Measurable:** The 5-day limit provides a quantifiable target.
*   **Not Directly Tied to User Tasks:** It’s not about a user performing a specific action, but about the system’s ability to support different markets.

Would you like me to elaborate on why this is classified as an NFR, or perhaps provide examples of other types of requirements (e.g., functional, performance, security)?


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on the *duration* and *stability* of the system's operation – “for a minimum of 5 years.” This describes a performance characteristic (longevity) rather than a specific feature or behavior. It’s about the system’s ability to continue functioning reliably over time, which falls under the umbrella of non-functional requirements like reliability, maintainability, and scalability. 

Let me know if you’d like to classify another requirement!


**Non-Functional Requirement (NFR)** – Specifically, this falls under **Performance & Reliability**.

Here’s why:

*   **Reliability & Alerting:** It’s about ensuring the system reliably alerts users to important updates, which is a core aspect of system reliability.
*   **Not a Feature:** It’s not about *what* the system *does* (e.g., managing classes), but *how* it communicates those changes.

**Key Characteristics of an NFR:**

*   Measurable (though the specifics of “notify” aren’t quantifiable here, the *reliability* of the notification is implied).
*   Often expressed in terms of speed, accuracy, or availability.


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a performance characteristic of the system – its ability to handle multiple concurrent users streaming content.  It’s a technical constraint related to capacity and scalability, rather than a specific feature or behavior.  It’s a measurable quality attribute of the system.


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific behavior of the system – what it *does* when certain conditions are met (no ratings defined). Non-functional requirements (NFRs) typically deal with qualities like performance, reliability, usability, security, and constraints. This requirement directly relates to the system’s behavior under a specific circumstance, making it a clear NFR. 

Here's why it's not a functional requirement:

*   **Functional requirements** define *what* the system *does* – a specific action or task. This requirement describes *how* the system responds to a lack of data, which is a characteristic of its operation.


**Non-Functional Requirement (Performance)**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement directly addresses the *speed* at which a system action (generating and delivering the audit report) must occur.  “Within 10 seconds” is a clear performance metric.  It’s not about *what* the system does (like data integrity or security), but *how quickly* it performs a specific task.


**Non-Functional Requirement (Performance)**

This requirement falls squarely into the category of performance requirements. It specifically addresses the speed and responsiveness of a system component – the search for recycled parts. 

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on Speed:** It explicitly states a time constraint (15 seconds) for a specific action.
*   **System Response:** It’s about how quickly the system responds to a user’s request.

Would you like me to elaborate on why this is a key characteristic of a non-functional requirement, or perhaps provide an example of how this type of requirement would be tested?


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on system maintenance, data hygiene, and ensuring the database remains accurate and relevant. It’s about *how* the system operates and performs, rather than *what* it does (e.g., processing disputes). It’s a constraint on the system’s behavior – a rule that must be followed to maintain data integrity. 

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Non-Functional Requirement (NFR)** – Specifically, this falls under **Service Level Agreement (SLA)** or **Availability**.

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on Performance/Availability:** This requirement dictates how the system *behaves* – it needs to proactively inform users about policy changes. This directly impacts the user experience and how reliable the system is.
*   **Not Core Functionality:** It’s not about *what* the system does (e.g., processing disputes) but *how* it communicates updates.

**Therefore, it’s an NFR related to communication and user experience.**


**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, this falls under **Performance & Reliability**.

Here’s the breakdown:

*   **Focus:** It describes a specific performance characteristic – the speed of updates (5 minutes) and the impact on users (80% successful installation).
*   **Metric:**  It establishes a measurable target (5 minutes) and a success rate (80%).
*   **Impact:** It directly relates to how quickly the system can be updated and maintained, which is a key factor in overall system reliability and user satisfaction.

**Type:** **Business Requirement / Metric**

**Explanation:**

This requirement isn’t a technical specification for a system feature. Instead, it’s a desired outcome – a specific statistic (70% comfort level) that the system (website) is expected to achieve. It’s a measure of success and a key business metric. 

Here’s why it’s not other types:

*   **Not Functional:** It doesn’t describe *how* the system should work.
*   **Not Non-Functional:** While it relates to user experience, it’s more about a quantifiable result rather than a quality attribute like performance or security.
*   **Not User Story:** It’s too broad and doesn’t focus on a specific user need or task.

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a performance characteristic of the system – its ability to handle a certain number of concurrent users.  Non-functional requirements (often called “quality attributes”) define *how* a system should behave, rather than *what* it should do.  It’s about performance, scalability, and reliability, not a specific feature or function.


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes *what* the system *does* – it generates a specific report (a printable summary) containing data about clinical site lab schedules. It’s about the functionality and output of the system, not about performance, security, or other non-functional aspects. 

Here's why it's not other classifications:

*   **Non-Functional:** It doesn’t describe performance, security, usability, or any other characteristic *of* the system.
*   **Data:** It’s a description of the *content* of a report, not the data itself.


**Non-Functional Requirement (Performance)**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement directly addresses the *speed* and *efficiency* of a system component – the login process. It’s a measurable characteristic of the system’s performance. The “under 5 seconds” specifies a quantifiable target. 

Here's why it’s not other types of requirements:

*   **Not Functional:** It’s not a core *function* of the system (like “users can view reports”).
*   **Not Usability:** While speed impacts usability, this requirement focuses on a technical performance metric.
*   **Not Data:** It doesn’t describe data content or structure.


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a *behavior* of the system – how it presents information to the user. It’s about the system’s functionality and performance, not about *what* the system does (like processing data or scheduling classes). Displaying an audit report is a technical aspect of the system’s operation.


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a measurable performance target – 100% success rate after training. It’s focused on the *quality* of the system’s output (successful follow-up actions) and the efficiency of user training.  It’s not about *what* the system does, but *how well* it’s used and learned.  Non-functional requirements often deal with aspects like performance, reliability, usability, and maintainability.


**Functional:**

This requirement describes a specific action that users (Program Administrators and Nursing Staff) can perform within the system – modifying details about Clinical Sites. This directly relates to how the system *does* something. 

**Reasoning:**

NFRs typically describe qualities like performance, reliability, security, and availability, which are crucial for a system's overall success.  This specific requirement focuses on the operational hours during which the system must be accessible.


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a system characteristic – how the system *behaves* – rather than a specific feature or function. It’s about data persistence and retention, which falls under the umbrella of system reliability, data management, and potentially security (depending on the context). 

Here's why it's not a functional requirement:

*   **Focus on Behavior:** It dictates *what* the system *must do* with data, not *how* it performs a specific task.
*   **System Characteristic:** It’s a fundamental aspect of the system’s operation – ensuring data isn’t lost.

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific *capability* of the system – the ability to add classes to a sequence. However, it doesn’t specify *how* that capability should be implemented, its performance characteristics, or any constraints on its use. It’s focused on what the system *should do* rather than *how* it should do it. 

Here's why it's not a functional requirement:

*   **No specific behavior:** It doesn't detail the steps involved in adding a class, the data required, or the expected outcome.
*   **Focus on usability:** It’s more about the ease with which users can perform a task (adding a class) than the core functionality of the system.


**Classification: Operational/Technical**

Here’s a breakdown of why this requirement falls into the Operational/Technical category:

*   **Focus on Process & Integration:** The requirement centers around a specific, repeatable process – loading data from the BDW system. It’s not a feature related to user experience or a high-level business goal.
*   **Performance & Timeliness:** The key aspects are the timeframe (3 hours) and the frequency (5 times/year). These are all metrics related to operational efficiency.
*   **System Interaction:** It explicitly describes the interaction between two systems (RFS and BDW), which is a core technical element.

**Further Breakdown:**

*   **Operational:** This requirement is part of the day-to-day operations of the RFS system.
*   **Technical:** It involves specific technical details like data transfer, system integration, and performance targets.

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this classification?
