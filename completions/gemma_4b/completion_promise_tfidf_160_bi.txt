**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a *behavioral* aspect of the product – the sound effect produced when a ship is sunk. It’s not about *what* the product does (e.g., displaying information) but *how* it performs that function.  It’s a quality attribute related to user experience and immersion. 

Here's why it's not a functional requirement:

*   **Focus on Experience:** It’s about the *feel* of the game, not the core game mechanics (placing ships, checking for hits, etc.).
*   **Not Core Logic:** It doesn’t represent a fundamental rule or process within the game.


**Non-Functional Requirement**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes *how* the system operates – its interaction with another system (the faculty central server). It’s not a description of *what* the system does (e.g., manage student records) but rather a technical constraint or dependency.  Non-functional requirements often deal with aspects like integration, performance, security, and reliability – all of which are relevant here.


**Functional**

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on the *quality* of the system’s output – specifically, the language used. It’s not about *what* the system does (functional requirement) or *how quickly* it does it (performance requirement). Instead, it’s about adhering to established standards of language and terminology. This falls squarely into the category of quality attributes or non-functional requirements.


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific action – adding new classes to a sequence. It’s about *what* the system *does*, not a characteristic of its performance, availability, or user experience. It’s a core function of the system.


**Functional Requirement:** This requirement describes a specific action the product *must do*. It’s about a core function – updating conference rooms.

**Classification:**  **Core Functionality** or **Data Management** 

**Reasoning:** It’s not a quality attribute (like performance or availability) but a direct requirement for the product to operate correctly. It falls under the category of managing data (conference room information) and is a fundamental part of what the product *does*.



**Functional Requirement**

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on Behavior:** This requirement describes *what* the product should do – allow users to easily reserve conference rooms.
*   **Measurable Success:** The “90% of users” and “within 5 minutes” criteria provide a way to measure whether the product is meeting its goal.

Let's break down why it's not a Non-Functional Requirement:

*   **Non-Functional Requirements** typically describe *how* the system performs (e.g., performance, security, usability). While usability is important, this requirement is specifically about the *action* of reserving a room and the user’s ability to do so.


**Non-Functional** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on usability and system performance – specifically, how easily a user can find help and the responsiveness of the system. These are core characteristics of a system’s overall quality, rather than a specific feature or function. It’s about the *experience* of using the product, making it a non-functional requirement.


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Specifically: Usability/Performance** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a measurable characteristic of the product – its ease of use for a specific user group (novices).  It’s not a feature (like “the product must allow users to upload images”), but rather a quality attribute related to how well the product performs for its intended users.  It falls under the broader category of usability and performance requirements.


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific performance characteristic – the ability to *view* data clearly on a large screen.

*   **Measurable:** The system’s success is determined by whether students are correctly added to the cohort and assigned the appropriate program.

Let me know if you’d like to classify another requirement!


**Classification:** Non-Functional Requirement (NFR) – Security & Access Control

**Reasoning:**

This requirement directly addresses *how* the system operates and restricts access based on user roles (supervisors vs. others). It’s a security-related NFR focused on controlling access to a specific function (advertising empty time slots). 

Here's a breakdown of why it fits this category:

*   **Focus on Behavior:** It dictates a specific behavior of the system – only supervisors can advertise.
*   **Constraints:** It imposes a constraint on who can perform an action.
*   **Quality Attribute:** It relates to a quality attribute of the system – security and access control.

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes *how* the system should behave – it specifies a particular output (a report) and its purpose (planning). It’s not about *what* the system does (e.g., calculates something) but rather its presentation and usability for a specific user group.  Therefore, it falls under the category of non-functional requirements, specifically related to reporting and user experience.


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes *what* the system needs to do – allow a user (the adjuster) to change the assigned repair facility. It’s a specific action within the system’s workflow. It doesn’t dictate *how* the override is implemented, just that it’s possible.  Therefore, it falls squarely into the category of a functional requirement.


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a user experience metric – how engaging and appealing the product is.  It’s not a technical specification about functionality, performance, or security. Instead, it’s a measure of *usability* and *adoption*.  Metrics like “80% of users regularly using the product” fall squarely into the realm of non-functional requirements, specifically related to user satisfaction and adoption.


Non-Functional


**Non-Functional Requirement (NFR)** – Specifically, this falls under **Performance** and potentially **Usability**.

*   **Usability:** It also speaks to the user’s expectation of immediate access, contributing to a positive user experience.

**Key Characteristics of an NFR:**

*   It’s a quality attribute of the system.
*   It’s often measurable (though the exact metrics might need to be defined).
*   It describes *how* the system should behave, rather than *what* it should do.

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this classification?


**Functional Requirement**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific action the system *must* perform – displaying events or activities. It’s not a constraint on how the system *should* be, but rather what it *does*. Displaying information is a core function of a system, making it a functional requirement. 

Would you like me to classify another requirement from the list?


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Specifically: Usability Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on the *appearance* and *feel* of the product – the color scheme and fonts.  It’s directly related to how users *experience* the product.  Usability requirements are concerned with ease of use, efficiency, and overall user satisfaction, and this falls squarely within that category. 

It’s not a functional requirement (which describes *what* the product does), nor is it a performance requirement (which deals with speed or responsiveness).


**Non-Functional** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on *usability*, *performance*, and *customer experience* – all key aspects of a non-functional requirement. It’s not about *what* the system does (like retrieving a map or creating a study program), but rather *how well* it does it. Specifically, it addresses:

*   **Usability:** “Easy for customers with novice skills” directly relates to usability.
*   **Performance:** “In under 3 minutes” sets a performance target.
*   **Customer Experience:** The entire requirement is centered around the customer’s ability to successfully purchase and watch a movie.

Therefore, it falls squarely into the category of non-functional requirements, which describe qualities like performance, reliability, usability, and security.


**Non-Functional Requirement (Performance)**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement directly addresses the *speed* and *efficiency* of a system component (the search function). It’s a quantifiable metric – “no longer than 8 seconds.” This falls squarely into the category of performance requirements, which are concerned with how quickly and effectively a system operates under various conditions. 

Here's a breakdown of why it’s not other classifications:

*   **Functional Requirement:** It doesn’t describe *what* the system *does* (e.g., “the system shall allow users to submit a repair request”).
*   **Usability Requirement:** While speed *contributes* to usability, this requirement focuses solely on the time taken, not the ease of use or user experience.


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific *behavior* of the system – how it presents information (a graph). Non-functional requirements (NFRs) focus on qualities like performance, usability, reliability, and security. Displaying data in a graph is directly related to usability and how the system *behaves* rather than its core functionality. 

Let's break it down:

*   **Focus:** It’s about *how* the system presents information, not *what* the system does.
*   **Measurable:** While “easy to understand” could be a subjective measure, the specific request for a graph implies a quantifiable aspect (e.g., clarity, visual appeal).

**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes the *environment* in which the system will operate – a specific type of office setting (a Nursing Department at a university). It’s not about *what* the system *does* (its functionality), but rather *where* and *how* it’s expected to perform.  Requirements like this often relate to things like:

*   **Hardware Compatibility:**  Does it need to run on specific types of computers?
*   **Network Requirements:**  Does it need a reliable network connection?
*   **Usability in a noisy environment:** (as hinted at in one of the previous requirements)

Because it’s about the operational context, it falls squarely into the category of non-functional requirements – those that describe the qualities of the system, rather than its specific features.


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a system behavior – the ability to temporarily halt and restart data updates.

**Non-Functional Requirement**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a technical capability – the ability to seamlessly incorporate new map data – and specifies a desired level of ease and minimal support. This falls squarely into the category of non-functional requirements, which focus on *how* a system performs rather than *what* it does. It’s about usability, integration, and potentially performance (how easily it can be updated). 

Here's why it's not a functional requirement:

*   **Focus on Operation:** It’s not a core feature of the product itself (like “the user can create a report”). It’s about *how* that core functionality is supported.


**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, a **Performance Requirement**.

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on System Behavior:** This requirement describes *how* the Disputes application should behave under a specific load (350 concurrent users). It’s not about *what* the application does (e.g., process a dispute) but rather its ability to handle that activity efficiently.
*   **Measurable:** “Without any degradation of performance” implies a measurable criterion – acceptable response times, throughput, or resource utilization.

Let's break down why it’s not other types of requirements:

*   **Functional Requirement:** This describes a specific *function* the application must perform (e.g., process a chargeback).
*   **Usability Requirement:** This focuses on the user experience.
*   **Security Requirement:** This deals with protecting data and access.


**Non-Functional Requirement (NFR)** – Specifically, a Security NFR.

*   **Adaptability:** The product needs to be adaptable to different languages.
*   **Maintainability:** The 5-day timeframe indicates a process for ongoing maintenance and updates related to language support.

**Why it’s not a Functional Requirement:**

A functional requirement would describe *what* the product *does* (e.g., “The product shall display a user interface in Spanish”). This requirement describes *how* the product is maintained and adapted to support different languages.


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a system’s *performance* and *stability* over a long period. It’s not about *what* the system does (e.g., manage curriculum) but *how well* it does it – specifically, its ability to sustain operation and handle data for an extended timeframe.  This falls squarely into the category of non-functional requirements, often referred to as “quality attributes.”


**Functional Requirement**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes *what* the system *does* – it specifies a notification process triggered by changes to class information.
