**Non-Functional** – Specifically, this is a **Performance** or **Constraints** requirement.

Here’s why:

*   **Constraints:** It’s a limitation on the system’s capabilities – the screen resolution is a hard limit.
*   **Performance:** It directly impacts the user experience – a low resolution screen would be unsuitable for many tasks.

It’s not a functional requirement (what the system *does*) but rather a technical constraint on *how* it operates.

**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, a **Reliability** requirement.

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on System Behavior:** This requirement describes *how* the system should behave under a specific condition (power failure). It’s not about a specific feature or functionality.
*   **Performance/Availability:** It directly relates to the system’s ability to remain operational and available, even in a challenging scenario.
*   **Quality Attribute:** This falls squarely within the category of “Availability” or “Reliability” quality attributes.

Would you like me to classify another requirement?
