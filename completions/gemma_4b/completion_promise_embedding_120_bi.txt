**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes *what* the system *does* – it generates a printable report with specific data. It’s about the functionality of the system, not about its performance, security, or usability. It’s a clear specification of a deliverable feature.


**Functional Requirement**

This requirement describes a specific behavior of the system – simulating a sound effect. It’s directly tied to a defined game state (ship sinking) and dictates a specific output (sound). Therefore, it falls squarely within the realm of functional requirements. 

Here’s why it’s not another type of requirement:

*   **Not Non-Functional:** It doesn’t relate to performance, security, usability, or any other characteristic of the system.
*   **Not a Constraint:** It’s not a limitation on what the system *can* do, but rather what it *should* do in a particular scenario.


Non-Functional


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific visual output and interaction within the product. It dictates *what* the product *does* – displays ship images in a grid – rather than specifying a non-functional characteristic like performance, security, or usability. It’s a core feature related to the gameplay mechanics.


**Non-Functional Requirement**

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on Technical Infrastructure:** This requirement describes a technical component (the database management system) and its integration with the product. It’s about *how* the product operates, rather than *what* the product does or how it’s used.
*   **Performance & Scalability:** Database choices directly impact performance, scalability, and data management – all key non-functional considerations.
*   **Not User-Facing:** It doesn’t relate to a user’s interaction with the product.

**Non-Functional Requirement (Usability)**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement directly relates to the ease of use and user experience of the product. A “standard navigation menu” is a key element of usability, ensuring users can quickly and intuitively find what they need.  It’s not a feature that delivers a specific function, but rather a design principle that impacts how effectively users can interact with the system. 

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a core action the product *must* perform – allowing a user to identify themselves. It’s about a specific capability the product needs to have to function correctly.  It’s not about performance, usability, or security (which would be non-functional requirements).


**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, a **Performance Requirement**.

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on Capacity:** This requirement directly addresses the system’s ability to handle a specific workload (transactions per hour).
*   **Measurable:** It sets a quantifiable target (10,000 and then 20,000).
*   **Time-Dependent:** It specifies a timeframe (within two years and then by Release 2) for achieving this capacity.

**Why it’s not a Functional Requirement:** Functional requirements describe *what* the system does (e.g., “The system shall allow users to submit a claim”). This requirement is about *how well* the system does it – its performance.


**Non-Functional Requirement**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a *technical* characteristic of the product – its ability to connect and interact with databases. It focuses on *how* the product functions (its performance and reliability in data communication) rather than *what* it does (e.g., processing disputes, generating reports).  The emphasis on "100% of all transactions" highlights a performance and reliability expectation, which is a core aspect of non-functional requirements.


**Functional Requirement**

This requirement describes *what* the system *does*. It specifies a specific action a user can take – paying for a movie with a pre-paid card. It’s about the core functionality of the system. 

Here’s why it’s classified as functional:

*   **Action-Oriented:** It describes a specific user action.
*   **Core Functionality:** It’s a key part of the system’s operation – enabling payment.

Let me know if you’d like me to classify another requirement!


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes constraints on the product’s design and appearance to meet external standards (ENET Securities) and internal governance (Architecture group). It focuses on adherence to rules and approval processes – characteristics of non-functional requirements. 

Here’s why it doesn’t fit into functional requirements:

*   **Not a core function:** It doesn’t define *what* the product *does* – it dictates *how* it must look and behave to meet external demands.
*   **Constraint/Quality Attribute:** It’s a constraint on the product’s design, representing a quality attribute like compliance or governance.


**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, this falls under **Performance** and **Availability**.

Here’s the breakdown:

*   **Performance:** The requirement focuses on *speed* – the time it takes to complete a process (lead cycle time). The specific targets (5 minutes, 3 minutes) are measurable performance metrics.
*   **Availability:** While not explicitly stated, the requirement implies a need for the system to be consistently available to meet these speed targets.

**Why it’s not Functional:** This requirement doesn’t describe *what* the system *does* (e.g., scoring leads, routing them to sales) – it describes *how quickly* it must perform a specific task.


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on *how* the system performs – specifically, the ease of use and perceived simplicity of the interface. This aligns with the core characteristics of non-functional requirements, which describe qualities like usability, performance, and maintainability, rather than what the system *does*. It’s a measure of the user experience, making it a non-functional requirement.


**Non-Functional Requirement**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes *how* the system should present information – specifically, displaying data from existing applications. It’s about the system’s functionality and performance in presenting information, rather than defining *what* the system *does* (e.g., manages leads, processes disputes). Displaying data is a core aspect of system operation and therefore falls under non-functional requirements like usability and data presentation.


**Non-Functional Requirement (Specifically, Usability & Localization)**

Here’s the breakdown of why it’s classified this way:

*   **Focus on Quality Attribute:** This requirement directly addresses a quality attribute – **Usability**. It’s about how easily and effectively users (in multiple countries) can interact with the product.
*   **Measurable Acceptance:** The “90% of survey respondents” clause introduces a measurable criterion for acceptance. This is a key characteristic of a good non-functional requirement.
*   **Internationalization:** It’s fundamentally about internationalization – adapting the product for diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.

**Why it’s *not* a Functional Requirement:**

A functional requirement describes *what* the system *does* (e.g., “The system shall allow users to log in”). This requirement doesn’t describe a specific action or function; it’s about the *quality* of the user experience.


**Non-Functional** 

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on Quality Attribute:** This requirement is fundamentally about the *quality* of the system’s output – specifically, the clarity and professionalism of the language used.
*   **Impact on System Behavior:** It dictates how the system *should* communicate, not how it performs a specific task.
*   **Measurable (to a degree):** While “consistent” is subjective, it implies a level of adherence to established standards, which could be assessed.

Let me know if you’d like to classify another requirement!


**Functional Requirement**

This requirement describes *what* the system needs to do – add new classes to a sequence. It’s a core function of the system, directly impacting its core capabilities. 

Here’s why it’s classified as functional:

*   **Action-Oriented:** It specifies an action (adding classes).
*   **Impacts Core Functionality:** Adding classes is a fundamental part of the system’s purpose (likely within a healthcare or educational context).

Let me know if you’d like me to classify another requirement!


**Functional Requirement**

This requirement directly relates to a specific action the system *must* perform – updating conference rooms. It’s not a constraint on how the system *should* be built or its performance, but rather a core function it needs to deliver. 

Here’s why it’s classified as functional:

*   **Action-Oriented:** It describes a specific task the system needs to accomplish.
*   **Impactful:** If the system doesn’t update conference rooms, it fails to meet a core need.

Would you like me to elaborate on why this classification is appropriate, or perhaps suggest how this requirement might be broken down into smaller, more manageable sub-requirements?


**Non-Functional Requirement (Specifically, Usability)**

Here’s the breakdown:

*   **Focus:** This requirement centers on the *ease of use* of the product.

**Non-Functional Requirement (Specifically, Usability)**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on *how* a user interacts with the product – ease of finding help. This falls squarely into the category of usability, which is a core non-functional requirement. It’s not about *what* the product does, but *how well* it’s designed for a user to accomplish their tasks.  It’s a measure of the system’s ease of use and effectiveness.



**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, this falls under **Usability** and **Performance**. 

Here’s why:

*   **Usability:** The requirement focuses on the ease with which a *specific* user group (novice users) can use the product.
*   **Performance:** The “90%” metric implies a performance target – the product needs to be usable by a significant portion of its intended audience.

It’s not a functional requirement (describing *what* the product does) but rather a quality attribute describing *how well* it performs for a particular user group.


**Non-Functional** – Specifically, this requirement falls under **Usability** and **Performance**.

Here’s why:

*   **Usability:** It directly addresses how easily the data can be understood by users (viewers) when presented visually.
*   **Performance:** It implicitly relates to the data’s readability at a specific viewing distance, suggesting a requirement for sufficient resolution or clarity.

Let's break down why it’s not Functional:

*   **Functional requirements** typically describe *what* the system *does* – a specific action or process. This requirement describes a *quality* of the output (readability) under a particular condition (large screen, viewing distance).


**Non-Functional** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes an *attribute* of the system – its security and data protection. It’s not about *what* the system does (like scheduling or processing disputes), but rather *how* it’s built and operates. Security requirements are always considered non-functional because they define qualities of the system rather than specific behaviors.


**Functional Requirement**

This requirement describes *what* the system must do – it dictates a specific capability or function. It’s about the core functionality of grouping students into cohorts and making them eligible for a specific program of study. 

Here’s why it’s classified as functional:

*   **Action-Oriented:** It specifies an action – making students eligible.
*   **Core Capability:** It’s a fundamental aspect of the system’s purpose.

Let me know if you’d like me to classify another requirement!


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a constraint on *who* can perform an action within the product. It’s about access control and permissions – a core aspect of system design and security. These types of requirements typically fall under the umbrella of non-functional requirements (NFRs), specifically focusing on aspects like security, access control, and authorization. 

Let's break down why it's not functional:

*   **Functional requirements** typically describe *what* the system *does* – the core features and behaviors.
*   This requirement dictates *how* the system *should behave* – a restriction on user access.


**Functional**

This requirement describes a specific action the system *must* perform – generating a report detailing class needs. It’s about functionality and data output, not about performance, usability, or security. It’s a core task the system needs to accomplish.


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific action the user (adjuster) can take within the system – overriding a suggested repair facility. This directly relates to how the system *functions* and how a user interacts with it to complete a task (creating an estimate). It’s not a constraint on performance, reliability, or a general rule about the system’s behavior.


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on user satisfaction and adoption – how *effectively* the product is used. It’s not a technical specification about functionality, performance, or security. Instead, it’s a measure of the product’s usability and perceived value, which falls squarely into the realm of non-functional requirements. It’s about the *experience* of using the product, not *what* the product does.


**Non-Functional Requirement (NFR) - Performance**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement directly relates to the *performance* of the system. Specifically, it dictates how frequently the system updates its visual presentation. Refreshing a display every 60 seconds is a measurable characteristic of system responsiveness and user experience. 

Here's why it's not another category:

*   **Functional Requirement:** It doesn't describe *what* the system *does* (e.g., "The system shall allow users to book classes").
*   **Usability Requirement:** While it impacts usability (a smooth, responsive interface), it’s a technical detail rather than a statement about ease of use.

Would you like me to classify another requirement from the list?

**Non-Functional Requirement** 

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on User Experience:** This requirement centers on the overall user experience and how the website is perceived by a specific demographic (Africans, specifically not just Nigerians).
*   **Quality Attribute:** It relates to quality attributes like usability, accessibility, and potentially localization (if the website needs to adapt to different cultural preferences).
*   **Not Core Functionality:** It doesn’t describe *what* the website *does* (e.g., streaming movies, processing disputes). It’s about *how* it’s presented and perceived.

**Therefore, it’s a Non-Functional Requirement.**


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific action a user can take within the system – purchasing a pre-paid card. It details the available options (values) and payment methods. This clearly falls under the category of what the system *does* – processing a transaction. 

Let me know if you’d like to classify another requirement!


**Non-Functional Requirement**

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on System Behavior:** This requirement describes *how* the system should behave – specifically, the ease with which it can be updated with new maps. It’s not about what the system *does* (like processing a transaction or generating a report).
*   **Operational Aspect:** It’s an operational requirement, dealing with maintenance and updates.
*   **Support Dependency:** The statement about minimal support highlights its operational nature – it’s about the system’s maintainability.

**Therefore, it’s a Non-Functional Requirement (NFR) – specifically, a Maintainability or Configuration NFR.**


**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, a **Performance Requirement**.

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on the *system’s ability to handle load* (350 concurrent users) and the *absence of negative consequences* (no degradation of performance).  It’s about how the system *behaves* under a certain level of demand, rather than a feature or functionality. 

Here's why it doesn't fit other categories:

*   **Functional Requirement:** It doesn't describe *what* the system *does* (e.g., “The system shall allow users to submit dispute requests”).
*   **Usability Requirement:** It doesn’t relate to how easy the system is to use.


**Non-Functional Requirement**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on *how* the system should operate – specifically, controlling access and permissions based on user roles. This falls squarely into the category of non-functional requirements, which define *quality attributes* of the system (like security, usability, and maintainability). 

Here's why it's not a functional requirement:

*   **Doesn't describe a specific function:** It doesn't detail *what* the system *does* (e.g., "create a dispute case").
*   **Defines a constraint:** It’s a constraint on *how* the system behaves – it dictates that access is governed by roles.

Let me know if you’d like to classify another requirement!


**Classification: Non-Functional Requirement (NFR) - Maintainability/Adaptability**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement falls squarely into the category of maintainability and adaptability. It describes a future capability – translating the product – and sets a specific, measurable timeframe for its implementation. This directly relates to how easily the product can be adapted to new markets and languages. 

Here’s a breakdown of why it’s an NFR:

*   **Measurable:** The “no more than 5 days” timeframe provides a quantifiable metric for assessing the product’s adaptability.
*   **Impacts System Behavior:** This requirement dictates a process and timeline for a future change to the product’s functionality.
*   **Not Core Functionality:** It’s not about the core game mechanics or primary user interaction. It’s an enhancement for global reach.

**Key Characteristics of an NFR:**

*   It describes quality attributes of the system (e.g., maintainability, adaptability).
*   It’s often expressed in terms of constraints or targets.
*   It’s verifiable (though verification might be challenging in the future).

Would you like me to classify another requirement, or perhaps elaborate on the characteristics of NFRs in more detail?

Here’s why it’s classified as functional:

*   **Action-Oriented:** It describes a specific action the system takes (notifying).
*   **Describes Behavior:** It defines how the system responds to a change.

Let me know if you’d like me to classify another requirement!


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a performance characteristic of the system – its ability to handle multiple concurrent users streaming data.  It’s about *how* the system performs under load, rather than *what* it does (e.g., the content being streamed).  Performance requirements are almost always classified as non-functional.


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific behavior of the system – how it *responds* to a lack of data. It’s not about what the system *does* (like processing a transaction or scheduling a class), but rather how it handles a particular state (no ratings defined).  Non-functional requirements often deal with qualities like performance, reliability, usability, or data handling – this falls squarely into the latter category.


**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, a **Performance Requirement**.

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on a *measurable* aspect of the system’s behavior – the speed at which a report is delivered.  It’s not about *what* the report contains (that’s a functional requirement), but *how quickly* it’s delivered.  The “10 seconds” timeframe is a quantifiable performance metric.


**Non-Functional Requirement (Performance)**

This requirement directly addresses the *speed* and *efficiency* of a system component – the recycled parts search.  It’s a key performance indicator (KPI) and falls squarely within the category of non-functional requirements. 

Here's why:

*   **Focus on Speed:** The core of the requirement is about response time – how quickly the system delivers results.
*   **Service Level Agreement (SLA) Potential:** This type of requirement could be used to define a service level agreement (SLA) for the search functionality.

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this classification?


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement deals with system maintenance, data integrity, and performance. It’s about ensuring the system remains healthy and efficient by removing outdated or irrelevant data. This falls squarely into the category of non-functional requirements, which focus on *how* the system performs and maintains its quality, rather than *what* it does. 

Here's why it's not a functional requirement:

*   **Doesn't define a core feature:** It doesn't describe a specific task or capability that the system provides to the user.
*   **Focuses on maintenance:** It’s about cleaning up the system, not about processing a user request or generating a report.


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a system behavior – notifying users about changes to a policy. This falls under the category of system behavior and performance, which are core aspects of non-functional requirements. Non-functional requirements focus on *how* a system performs, rather than *what* it does. 

Here's why it's not a functional requirement:

*   **Functional requirements** typically describe specific actions or features a system *must* perform (e.g., "The system must allow users to create a new account"). This requirement doesn't define a specific action; it describes a notification process.


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a process and a performance target (installation time). It’s about *how* the system operates and its reliability under specific conditions (installation speed for a significant portion of users). This falls squarely into the category of non-functional requirements, specifically relating to system performance and maintenance. 

Let's break down why it's not functional:

*   **Focus on Performance:** The core of the requirement is about the speed of a maintenance operation.
*   **Not Core Functionality:** It doesn't define *what* the system *does* – it’s about *how well* it does it.

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Business Requirement** 

This requirement falls squarely into the category of a **Business Requirement**. 

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on Outcome:** It’s not about a technical implementation or a system feature. It’s about a desired business outcome – customer satisfaction and willingness to adopt a new service.
*   **Measurable Goal:** The “70% comfortable” is a quantifiable metric used to assess the success of a business decision (likely related to launching a streaming movie service).
*   **Strategic Impact:** This requirement directly relates to the overall business strategy – understanding customer preferences and driving adoption of a new offering.

**Contrast with other classifications:**

*   **Functional Requirement:** This isn’t about *what* the system *does*, but *why* it’s doing it.
*   **Non-Functional Requirement:** While customer satisfaction is a non-functional aspect, this specific statement is about a *result* of that aspect.

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this classification?


**Non-Functional Requirement (Performance)**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement directly relates to the system’s ability to handle a specific load – the number of concurrent users.  This falls squarely into the category of performance requirements, specifically scalability and capacity. It’s not a feature (like “user authentication”) or a specific functionality (like “scheduling meetings”), but rather a measure of how well the system performs under load.


**Functional Requirement**

**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, this falls under **Performance** and **Usability**.

Here’s why:

*   **Performance:** The requirement focuses on a specific outcome – successful completion of a task – within a defined timeframe (first encounter).
*   **Usability:** It directly addresses the ease with which a user (merchant services representative) can perform a task.  The “100%” indicates a desired level of usability and efficiency.

**Key Characteristics of a Non-Functional Requirement:**

*   It describes *how* a system should behave, rather than *what* it should do.
*   It’s often measurable (e.g., “100%”).
*   It’s crucial for ensuring the system meets user needs and expectations.

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this classification?


**Functional Requirement**

Here’s why it’s classified as functional:

*   **Action-Oriented:** It specifies a specific action the system must perform (viewing cases).
*   **Describes a Capability:** It defines a key capability of the Disputes System.

Would you like me to elaborate on why this is a functional requirement, or perhaps provide an example of another type of requirement (e.g., non-functional)?


**Non-Functional Requirement**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a system *behavior* – how the system *processes* data to generate a score. It’s not about what the system *does* (e.g., displays a report) but rather *how* it performs a specific calculation.  Therefore, it’s a non-functional requirement focusing on performance, data processing, and potentially scalability.


**Non-Functional Requirement (NFR) - Availability**

This requirement specifically addresses the system’s uptime and operational hours. It’s a key aspect of reliability and user experience.


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on System Behavior:** This requirement describes how the system *should* behave – specifically, persisting data even after a user action (cancellation). It’s not about a specific feature or user interface element.
*   **Data Integrity & System Stability:** It’s fundamentally about data integrity and ensuring the system continues to function correctly, even in the face of user actions that might seem like they’re ending a relationship with the system.
*   **Not a User Story:** It doesn’t represent a specific task a user would perform.

Let me know if you’d like me to classify another requirement!


**Functional Requirement**

Here’s why it’s classified as functional:

*   **Action-Oriented:** It specifies an action – adding a class/section.
*   **System Behavior:** It defines a specific behavior the system must exhibit.

Would you like me to elaborate on why this is a functional requirement, or perhaps provide an example of how it might be tested?


**Non-Functional Requirement**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific technical interaction between two systems (RFS and BDW) and a defined timeframe for data loading. It focuses on *how* the system operates – the data transfer process – rather than the core functionality or user experience.  It’s concerned with performance (3 hours), frequency (5 times), and the technical integration aspect. 

Here's a breakdown of why it’s not a functional requirement:

*   **Not Core Functionality:** It doesn’t define *what* the RFS system *does* (e.g., budgeting, reporting).
*   **Performance/Integration Focused:** It’s about the speed and reliability of the data transfer, which is a technical detail.

Would you like me to categorize it further (e.g., performance, integration, data loading)?

*   **Quantifiable Metric:** It sets a specific target – 6 seconds – for response time.
*   **Service Level Agreement (SLA) Implication:** This could be considered a basic SLA element, guaranteeing a certain level of performance under a specific network condition.

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this classification, such as how this NFR might relate to other types of NFRs (e.g., Scalability, Reliability)?


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific process for updating the application – the timing and frequency of updates. This falls squarely into the category of non-functional requirements, which define *how* the system should behave, rather than *what* it should do. It’s about operational considerations, availability, and maintenance, not the core functionality of the system.


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement dictates a specific access control – who *can* access data. This falls squarely into the category of non-functional requirements, which define *how* a system should behave, rather than *what* it should do. It’s about security and data integrity, which are core aspects of a system’s overall functionality and performance. 

Here's why it's not functional: It doesn't describe a specific feature or task the system performs. Instead, it specifies a constraint on who can use the system.
