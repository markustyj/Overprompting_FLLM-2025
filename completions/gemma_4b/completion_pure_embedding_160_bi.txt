Here’s why:

*   **Focus on User Experience:** The requirement emphasizes “user-friendly” and “effortless creation.” This directly relates to how easily a user can interact with the system.
*   **Features as Constraints:** The specific features (customizable elements, text art, animated texts) are not core functionality but rather aspects that contribute to a good user experience.

**Classification:** Usability (with a strong emphasis on ease of use and intuitive design).


**Non-Functional Requirement Type:** **Quality Attribute** – Specifically, **Reliability** and **Availability**.

**Explanation:**

The statement describes a set of requirements designed to *improve* the overall quality of the system.  Phrases like "enhance performance," "improve reliability," "ensure availability," and "minimize downtime" all fall under the umbrella of quality attributes.  These attributes define *how well* the system performs its functions, rather than *what* functions it performs. 

This requirement is focused on making the system dependable and accessible to users.


**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, a requirement related to *User Interface (UI) and Display*.

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes *how* the system should present information to the user. It’s not about the core functionality of searching or data retrieval, but rather about the visual presentation of results.  It’s a quality attribute focused on usability and the user experience.  It falls under the category of performance and responsiveness, as it dictates how quickly and effectively the system displays its data.


**Non-Functional Requirement**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement specifies a technical implementation detail (the database system itself). It’s about *how* the system will operate, rather than *what* it will do or *how* it will perform.  It’s a constraint on the system’s architecture.  It’s not a functional requirement (e.g., “The system shall allow users to search for data”) nor a performance requirement (e.g., “The system shall respond to queries within 2 seconds”). 

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Functional**

This requirement describes a specific action the system *must* perform – prompting the user for input. It’s about the system’s behavior, not a constraint or quality attribute.

Would you like me to categorize any other requirements from the original list?


**Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:** This requirement directly describes a specific action a user (administrator) can perform within the system – approving job advertisements – and its outcome (publication). It’s a core function of the system. 

Here's a breakdown of why it’s not other classifications:

*   **Non-Functional:** While it impacts the system’s performance (approval speed), it’s not a characteristic like security, performance, or usability.
*   **Data Requirement:** It’s not simply about storing data; it’s about a process.


**Non-Functional Requirement**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific *quality* of the system – how the search results are presented. It’s not about *what* the system does (finding jobs) but *how* it presents the results.  Non-functional requirements (NFRs) typically deal with aspects like performance, usability, reliability, and maintainability – in this case, the way the user interacts with the search results.


**Classification:** **Functional & Security**

Here’s a breakdown of why:

*   **Functional:** The core of the requirement – “manage their private data” – directly relates to a user’s ability to interact with and control their information within the system.
*   **Security:** The inclusion of “the option to delete their personal repository” is a critical security aspect. It grants users control over their data, aligning with data privacy principles.

**Further Breakdown:**

*   It’s a feature request that impacts user experience and data governance.
*   It’s likely to be prioritized based on user needs and potential security implications.

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this classification?


**Non-Functional Requirement (NFR)** – Specifically, this falls under **Performance & Scalability** and **Data Management**.

Here’s why:

*   **Data Management:** This requirement directly addresses how data is structured and accessed. The ability to deploy a dataset type independent of apps dictates a robust data management system.

Let me know if you’d like to classify another requirement!


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a system *characteristic* – the ability to allow users to indicate their availability. It’s not a specific feature or function, but rather a quality of the system’s operation.  It relates to usability and how the system interacts with users. 

Here's why it's not a functional requirement: A functional requirement would describe *what* the system *does* (e.g., "The system shall allow users to submit a request for time off"). This requirement describes *how* that functionality is delivered – through a user interface that allows selection of availability.


**Non-Functional Requirement (Performance)**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement directly addresses the *speed* at which a system component (generating the recycled parts audit report) must operate.  “Within 10 seconds” is a clear performance metric.  It’s not about *what* the system does (the content of the report) but *how quickly* it delivers that content. Therefore, it falls squarely into the category of performance requirements.


**Functional Requirement**

This requirement – “The system shall provide the functionality for users to follow other users” – clearly describes a specific action a user can take within the system. It’s a defined behavior, not a quality attribute like performance or usability. Therefore, it falls squarely into the category of a functional requirement.



**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, a requirement related to **Usability** and **Accessibility**.

Here’s why:

*   **Usability:** It directly addresses how easily a user can access and utilize the system (in this case, the Skype app).

*   **Metric:** It uses a quantifiable metric (99.5%) to define that availability.
*   **Impact:**  A low availability percentage would have significant consequences for users and the system’s overall functionality.

Would you like me to elaborate on how this type of requirement is typically handled in a system’s specifications or documentation?


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a fundamental security and operational aspect of the system – verifying user identities and establishing accounts. It’s not a feature *what* the system *does*, but rather *how* it operates securely.  It’s a core security mechanism and therefore falls under the category of non-functional requirements (often referred to as “quality attributes”). 

Here's why it's not a functional requirement:

*   **Focus on Security:** It’s primarily about *how* authentication is performed, not the specific actions a user can take *after* logging in.
*   **Technical Implementation:** It describes the underlying mechanism (authentication) rather than a user-facing feature.


**Functional Requirement**

This requirement clearly describes a specific action the system needs to perform – “harvest metadata on funded research outputs.” This directly relates to a defined function and contributes to the overall purpose of the system.

*   **Security & Performance:** Authentication and payment processes are inherently tied to security and performance considerations.
*   **Testable:** This requirement can be tested – can the system successfully authenticate a user and process a bankcard payment?

**Therefore, it falls squarely into the category of a Non-Functional Requirement (NFR).**


**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, a **Usability Requirement**.

Here’s why:

* **Focus on Quality Attribute:** This requirement directly addresses a *quality attribute* of the system – usability.  Usability is about how easy the system is to use, learn, and be efficient with.
* **Impact on System Behavior:**  Adhering to UX design best practices *influences* how the system behaves and how users interact with it. It’s not a feature itself, but a principle guiding the design.
* **Measurable (Potentially):** While not directly measurable, adherence to UX best practices *can* be assessed through user testing, heuristic evaluations, and other UX research methods.

**Contrast with a Feature Requirement:** A feature requirement would be something like “The system shall allow users to upload images.” That’s a specific functionality. This requirement is about *how* that functionality is delivered – through good UX design.

Would you like me to elaborate on why this is classified this way, or perhaps provide an example of how this requirement might be further broken down into more specific, testable requirements?


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a *behavior* or *quality* of the system – how it *should* respond to user issues. It’s not a specific feature or function, but rather a characteristic of the system’s operation.  It focuses on the *outcome* (feasible solutions) rather than *how* the system achieves that outcome. 

Here's why it's not a functional requirement:

*   **Focus on Behavior:** It describes *what* the system should do (provide solutions) rather than *how* it does it.
*   **Quality Attribute:** It’s a quality attribute related to usability, customer satisfaction, and potentially support efficiency.


**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, a **Data Quality/Data Integrity** requirement.

Here’s why:

*   **Addresses a Problem:** The requirement explicitly acknowledges data that’s “hard to extract.” This indicates a potential issue with data quality or the availability of automated extraction methods.
*   **Manual Intervention:** The solution – manual extraction by a developer – highlights a fallback mechanism for ensuring data is included, even if automated methods fail.
*   **Impacts System Behavior:** This requirement directly influences how the system handles data and potentially impacts its overall reliability and completeness.

**Why it’s not Functional:** It doesn’t describe a specific *function* the system performs (like searching or displaying data). Instead, it’s a requirement for how the system *deals with* data challenges.


Here’s a classification of the requirement: “System shall be able to provide a list of the 3 nearest sites, sorted alphabetically by name, with links to their respective pages.”

**Classification:** **Functional Requirement** – Specifically, a **Data Retrieval & Display** requirement.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Functional:** This requirement describes *what* the system *must do* – it specifies a particular output (a list of sites) and how that list should be generated (based on proximity and sorted).
*   **Data Retrieval & Display:** The core function is to retrieve data (site locations) and then present it to the user in a structured format (a list with links).

**Further Breakdown:**

*   **Specific:** It’s not a general requirement like “The system must display information.” It’s very precise about the number of results, the sorting criteria, and the inclusion of links.
*   **Testable:** This requirement can be easily tested – verify that the system returns the correct number of sites, sorts them correctly, and provides links to each.
