**Functional Requirement**

This requirement describes *what* the system *must do*. It specifies a particular output – a printable summary – and details the information included in that summary (student list, program sequence, progress, and timeline).  It’s about the system’s functionality.

Here’s why it’s classified as functional:

*   **Action-Oriented:** It describes a specific action the system needs to perform (generate a printable summary).
*   **Data-Driven:** It specifies the data that *must* be included in the output.

**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific action the product *does* – it generates a sound effect. It’s about a defined behavior and outcome, rather than a constraint, performance metric, or user experience consideration. It’s a core element of the game’s functionality. 

Let me know if you’d like to classify another requirement!


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes *what* the system *does* – it interacts with another system (the faculty central server). This directly relates to the system's core functionality and how it interacts with other components.  It’s not a constraint on performance, security, or usability – those would be non-functional requirements.


**Non-Functional** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a visual presentation aspect of the product – how the ships are displayed. It’s about the *appearance* and *user interface* – which falls squarely into the category of non-functional requirements. Non-functional requirements deal with qualities like performance, usability, reliability, and appearance, rather than the core functionality of the system.


**Non-Functional Requirement**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a technical component (the database system) that *enables* the product to function. It’s not a feature of the product itself, but rather a dependency.  Non-functional requirements typically address qualities like performance, scalability, reliability, and technical constraints – all of which this requirement falls under. It’s about *how* the product is built and supported, rather than *what* the product does.


**Usability** 

This requirement falls squarely under the category of usability. It’s directly addressing how easy the product is to learn and use – specifically, by adhering to a common and recognizable navigation pattern. 

Here’s why it’s classified as usability:

*   **User Experience:** It’s about making the product intuitive for the average user.
*   **Learnability:** A standard menu reduces the learning curve for new users.
*   **Efficiency:** Users can quickly find what they need.

Would you like me to classify another requirement from the list?


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a core action the user can perform within the system – identifying themselves as a player. This directly relates to the system’s functionality and how it operates. It’s not a design aesthetic, performance characteristic, or security measure; it’s about the user’s ability to participate in the system’s core activity.


**Non-Functional Requirement (Performance)**

Here’s why:

*   **Quantifiable:** It specifies a precise number of transactions (10,000 and 20,000).
*   **Time-Based:** It’s tied to a specific timeframe (within two years and by Release 2).
*   **Focuses on System Behavior:** It describes *how* the system should perform under load – its capacity and scalability.

Let me know if you’d like me to classify another requirement!


**Non-Functional Requirement (Performance/Technical)**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement directly addresses the *technical* aspects of the product’s operation – how it interacts with databases. It focuses on a specific, measurable outcome (successful communication) and a key performance indicator (100% success rate).  It’s not a feature describing *what* the product does, but *how* it does it. 

Here's a breakdown of why it’s classified this way:

*   **Technical:** It’s about the underlying technology – the database interface.
*   **Performance:** The “100% of all transactions” implies a performance expectation – reliable data exchange.
*   **Testable:** This requirement can be tested and verified through rigorous database integration testing.

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Non-Functional Requirement**

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on System Behavior:** This requirement describes *how* the system should operate – accepting a specific payment method. It’s not about the core functionality of streaming a movie itself.
*   **Performance/Usability:** It touches on usability (how easily a customer can pay) and potentially performance (how quickly the payment is processed).
*   **Not Core Functionality:** It’s an added feature, not a fundamental part of the streaming service.

Therefore, it’s best classified as a non-functional requirement.


**Non-Functional Requirement (NFR) - Usability & Design**

Here’s the breakdown of why it’s classified as an NFR, specifically within the category of usability and design:

*   **Focus on External Standards:** The requirement explicitly states adherence to “ENET Securities intranet page standards and requirements.” This indicates a constraint driven by an external entity.
*   **Quantitative Metric:** The “95%” approval rate provides a measurable target for the design and look & feel. This is a key characteristic of NFRs.
*   **Process & Timeline:** The requirement also includes a process (approval by the Architecture group) and a timeline (one month for corrections), further solidifying its status as an NFR.

**Why it’s NOT a Functional Requirement:**

A functional requirement describes *what* the system *does* – the core functionality. This requirement focuses on *how* the system *looks* and *how it aligns with external standards*, which is a design and usability concern.

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this classification, or perhaps provide examples of other types of requirements (e.g., performance, security)?


**Non-Functional Requirement**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on *performance* – specifically, the speed at which a process (lead management) completes. It’s a measurable characteristic of the system’s behavior under specific conditions (business hours vs. off-hours).  It’s not about *what* the system does (e.g., lead scoring) but *how quickly* it does it.  The percentages (90% and 99%) further emphasize this performance aspect.


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on a *quality attribute* of the system – usability. It’s not about *what* the system does (like processing transactions or displaying data), but rather *how well* it performs. The 90% success rate (beta tester satisfaction) is a measurable criterion for achieving that quality attribute. Therefore, it falls squarely into the category of non-functional requirements.


**Functional Requirement**

This requirement clearly describes a specific action the system *must* perform – displaying data from two specific applications. It’s not about usability, aesthetics, or performance; it’s about the core functionality of the system. 

Here’s why it’s classified as functional:

*   **Action-Oriented:** It specifies *what* the system needs to do (display data).
*   **Data Dependency:** It relies on the existence and operation of other systems (Sync Matrix 1.0 and Exercise Management Tool 1.0).

Would you like me to elaborate on why this classification is appropriate, or perhaps suggest how this requirement could be further refined for clarity?


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on usability and acceptance from a diverse user base. It’s about the *quality* of the product’s language – its suitability for different cultures – rather than a specific function or behavior.  It’s a measure of how well the product meets a user need (understanding and using the product) and is therefore a non-functional requirement.


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on *how* the system *should be* – specifically, the language used. It’s not about *what* the system does (functional) but rather the quality and consistency of its communication.  Requirements like this relate to usability, understandability, and adherence to established standards, which are core aspects of non-functional requirements.


**Functional Requirement**

This requirement describes *what* the system needs to do – add new classes to a sequence. It’s a core function of the system. 

Here’s why it’s classified as functional:

*   **Action-Oriented:** It specifies an action (adding classes).
*   **Describes a Capability:** It defines a key capability of the system – managing class sequences.

Let me know if you’d like me to classify another requirement!


**Functional Requirement**

This requirement clearly describes an action the product *must* perform – updating conference rooms. It’s a specific task within the system’s capabilities. 

Here’s why it’s classified as functional:

*   **Action-Oriented:** It specifies what the product *does*.
*   **Measurable:**  The “update” implies a change, and the extent of that change could potentially be defined (e.g., updating room details, capacity, equipment).

Let me know if you’d like me to classify another requirement!


**Non-Functional Requirement (Performance & Usability)**

Here’s the breakdown of why it’s classified this way:

*   **Performance:** The requirement explicitly states a time constraint – “within 5 minutes.” This directly relates to system performance and responsiveness.
*   **Usability:** The statement “90% of users will be able to successfully reserve a conference room” indicates a usability goal – the system should be intuitive and easy for users to accomplish a core task.

**Key Characteristics:**

*   **Measurable:** The 5-minute time limit and 90% success rate provide quantifiable metrics for assessing the requirement.
*   **User-Centric:** It focuses on the user’s experience and ability to interact with the system.

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on usability and the availability of support. It’s not about *what* the system does (a functional requirement) but *how* it’s used and the accessibility of assistance.  It’s a measure of the system’s ease of use and the effectiveness of its help features.


**Non-Functional Requirement (NFR)** – Specifically, this falls under **Usability** and **Performance**.

Here’s why:

*   **Usability:** The requirement directly addresses how easy the product is to use, focusing on a key user group (novice users).
*   **Performance:**  The “90%” target implies a level of performance – in this case, a reasonable percentage of users should find it usable.

It’s not a functional requirement (like “the product must allow users to create accounts”) because it doesn’t describe a specific action the product *does*. Instead, it’s a measure of *how well* the product performs in terms of user experience.


**Non-Functional** – Specifically, this falls under **Usability** and **Performance**.

Here’s why:

*   **Usability:** The requirement focuses on the *readability* of the data, directly impacting how easily users can understand and interpret the information.
*   **Performance:** While not explicitly stated, the requirement implies a certain level of data presentation quality – a projection that’s easily readable suggests a reasonable level of data processing and display speed.

It’s not a functional requirement (like “the system must calculate X”) but rather a quality attribute that describes how the system *should* behave from a user’s perspective.


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a quality attribute of the system – specifically, data security and access control. It’s not a feature that *does* something, but rather a characteristic of *how* the system operates. It’s about ensuring data integrity and preventing unauthorized access, which are core aspects of system design and operation. 

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Functional Requirement**

This requirement describes a specific *function* the system must perform – allowing students to be added to a cohort and, consequently, participate in that cohort’s defined Program of Study. It’s about what the system *does*. 

Here’s why it’s classified as functional:

*   **Action-Oriented:** It specifies an action (adding students) and a resulting state (eligibility for the program).
*   **System Behavior:** It defines how the system behaves when a student is added to a cohort.

Let me know if you’d like me to classify another requirement!


**Non-Functional Requirement (NFR) - Security & Access Control**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement directly addresses *how* the system operates and restricts access based on a user role (supervisor). It’s not about a specific feature’s functionality, but rather about *who* can perform a particular action. This falls squarely into the category of security and access control, a core aspect of NFRs. 

Here's a breakdown of why it's an NFR:

*   **Constraint:** It imposes a restriction on user behavior.
*   **Quality Attribute:** It relates to a quality attribute of the system – security and access control.
*   **Measurable (Potentially):** While not explicitly stated, the requirement could be tested to ensure that only supervisors can indeed advertise empty time slots.

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes *what* the system needs to do – generate a report detailing class needs. It’s about a specific function the system performs. It doesn’t address qualities like performance, security, or usability. 

Here's a breakdown of why it’s not the other categories:

*   **Non-Functional:** This would cover aspects like speed, reliability, security, or ease of use.
*   **Data:** This would describe the data itself, not the system’s ability to process it.


**Functional Requirement**

This requirement describes *what* the system needs to do – it dictates a specific action a user (the adjuster) can take within the system. It’s about a defined process and capability. 

Here’s why it’s classified as functional:

*   **Action-Oriented:** It specifies a user action – overriding a repair facility.
*   **System Behavior:** It describes how the system will respond to that action.

Let me know if you’d like me to classify another requirement!


**Non-Functional Requirement (Usability/User Experience)**

**Justification:**

This requirement focuses on the *experience* of the user – specifically, whether they find the product engaging and want to continue using it.  It’s not about a technical function or performance metric, but about user satisfaction and adoption. The 80% usage rate after two weeks is a quantifiable measure of this user experience. 

Here's why it doesn't fit other categories:

*   **Functional:** It doesn't describe a specific function the product *does*.
*   **Performance:** It’s not about speed, response time, or resource usage.
*   **Security:** It doesn't relate to data protection or vulnerability.

Would you like me to classify another requirement from the list?


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific behavior of the system – how often the display updates. It’s not about *what* the system does (like processing data) but *how* it performs that function.  Non-functional requirements (NFRs) typically focus on qualities like performance, reliability, usability, and maintainability.  In this case, it’s a performance-related NFR – specifically, the refresh rate of the display.


**Functional Requirement**

This requirement describes *what* the system *must do*. It specifies a core functionality – the ability to stream movies on-demand – which is a key feature of the system. 

Let's break it down:

*   **"All movies"**: Defines the scope – all available movies.
*   **"shall be streamed"**:  Specifies the action – streaming.
*   **"on demand"**:  Highlights the user-driven nature of the access.
*   **"at any time of the day"**:  Defines the availability – 24/7 access.

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Functional Requirement**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes *what* the system *does* – it’s about presenting information (events and activities). It’s not about *how* the system does it (e.g., the technology used, the performance characteristics).  Displaying information is a core function of most systems. 

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on the *appearance* and *usability* of the product – specifically, the visual design.  It’s about how the product *feels* to use, rather than a core functional capability.  Non-functional requirements often deal with qualities like performance, security, usability, and maintainability.


**Non-Functional** – Specifically, this falls under **Usability** and **Performance**.

Here’s why:

*   **Usability:** The requirement focuses on ease of use for “customers with novice skills on the Internet.” This directly relates to how easy the product is to learn and use.
*   **Performance:** The “under 3 minutes” time constraint is a performance metric – it’s about how quickly the user can complete a task.

It’s not a functional requirement (like “the product shall allow users to search for movies”) but rather a quality attribute that describes how well the product meets user expectations in terms of ease of use and speed.


**Non-Functional Requirement (Performance)**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement directly addresses the *speed* and *efficiency* of a system component (the search for a repair facility).  It’s a quantifiable metric – “no longer than 8 seconds.”  Non-functional requirements (often called “quality attributes”) focus on characteristics like performance, reliability, security, usability, etc. This clearly falls into the performance category.


**Functional Requirement**

This requirement describes *what* the system should do – it specifies the display of events in a graph. It’s about the system’s behavior and output. 

Here’s why it’s classified as functional:

*   **Action-oriented:** It describes an action the system needs to perform (displaying data in a graph).
*   **Observable:** The outcome (the graph) is something that can be observed and verified.

Let me know if you’d like to classify another requirement!


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a system behavior – what *should* happen when a game ends. It’s not about *what* the system does to achieve a goal (like a functional requirement), but rather a constraint on *how* it operates. It’s a technical limitation or characteristic of the system’s performance. 

Let's break it down:

*   **Focus on Behavior:** It specifies an action (removing a player) under a specific condition (game end).
*   **Not a Goal:** It doesn't define a desired outcome or objective.

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, a **User Interface (UI) Requirement** or **Presentation Requirement**.

Here’s why:

**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes the *environment* in which the system must function. It’s not about *what* the system *does* (a functional requirement) but rather *where* and *how* it operates.  It’s a constraint on the system’s design and implementation, focusing on its suitability for a specific setting.  Therefore, it falls under the category of non-functional requirements, specifically related to environment and usability.


**Non-Functional Requirement**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a technical characteristic of the system – how it handles data updates. It’s about performance, reliability, and potentially resource management. It’s not a specific feature or behavior, but rather a quality of the system’s operation. 

Here's why it's not functional:

*   **Focus on Behavior:** It dictates *how* the system operates (pausing and resuming) rather than *what* it does (e.g., displaying data, processing transactions).
*   **Performance/Reliability:** It relates to aspects like responsiveness, stability, and potentially resource usage during data updates.


**Business Requirement** 

This requirement falls squarely into the category of a **business requirement**. It’s focused on a specific user (the owner) and their desired access to a feature (streaming movies). It’s not about technical implementation, performance, or security – it’s about fulfilling a user’s need. 

Here’s why it’s not the others:

*   **Functional Requirement:** It doesn’t describe *what* the system *does* (like processing a transaction or generating a report).
*   **Non-Functional Requirement:** While it touches on usability (easy access), it’s not primarily about performance, security, or reliability.


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific action the system *must* perform – allowing users to directly input dispute case data and receive immediate feedback.

It’s not describing a specific feature or behavior, but rather the underlying mechanism for controlling access and ensuring data security.  It’s about access control, permissions, and role-based security – all core aspects of NFRs. 

Here's why it doesn't fit other categories:

*   **Functional Requirement:** It doesn't describe *what* the system *does* (e.g., "The system shall allow users to create reports").
*   **Usability Requirement:** While security impacts usability, this requirement is primarily about access control, not the ease of use.


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a technical capability of the product – its ability to store data (room equipment).  Non-functional requirements (NFRs) focus on *how* a system performs, rather than *what* it does.  This falls squarely into the category of performance, reliability, and maintainability – all aspects of an NFR.


**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, a **Maintenance & Support** requirement.

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on Future Operations:** This requirement isn’t about core functionality (like gameplay or scheduling). It’s about how the product *will* be maintained and adapted for future expansion.
*   **Time Constraint:** The “no more than 5 days” is a specific timeframe for a process (localization).

It’s not about *what* the system does (e.g., create a report) but *how well* it does it over time.  It’s a durability and scalability concern, which are hallmarks of non-functional requirements. 

Would you like me to classify another requirement?


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a system behavior – *what* the system *does* when something changes – rather than *how* it’s built or *what* it’s supposed to do. It’s about notification and alerting, which falls squarely into the category of non-functional requirements (NFRs). Specifically, it relates to aspects like:

*   **Reliability:** Ensuring users are informed of changes.
*   **Usability:** Providing a way for users to stay updated.
*   **Performance:** (Potentially – if the notification process itself has performance implications).

Let's break down why it’s not a functional requirement:

*   **Functional requirements** typically describe *what* a system *does* (e.g., “The system shall allow users to register for a course”). This requirement doesn’t tell us *what* the system *does*; it describes *how* it informs users.


**Non-Functional Requirement** – Specifically, this falls under **Performance** or **Capacity**. 

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on System Behavior:** This requirement describes a measurable characteristic of the system’s behavior – its ability to handle multiple concurrent connections.
*   **Not a Feature:** It’s not about *what* the system does (e.g., “allow users to stream videos”) but *how well* it does it.
*   **Testable:** It can be objectively measured and tested to ensure the system meets the specified capacity.
