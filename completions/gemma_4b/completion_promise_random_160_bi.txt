**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a *behavioral* aspect of the product – the sound effect produced when a ship is sunk. It’s not about *what* the product does (like data processing or user interaction), but rather *how* it presents itself and provides feedback to the user.  These types of requirements relate to the user experience and are therefore classified as non-functional.


Non-Functional


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a visual presentation aspect of the product – *how* the data is displayed. It’s about the user interface and the visual representation of information, rather than a core business function or a specific behavior. It’s a characteristic of the product’s design and user experience.


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a technical dependency – the need for a specific database system. It’s about *how* the product is built and operates, rather than *what* the product does or its features.  It’s a technical constraint, impacting architecture and implementation, rather than a user-facing functionality.


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a characteristic of the user interface – its usability and familiarity. It’s about *how* the product should function from a user experience perspective, rather than a specific feature or behavior.  It falls under the umbrella of usability and user experience, which are core aspects of non-functional requirements.


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific action a user can take within the product – identifying themselves as a player. It’s about *what* the product *does*, not *how* it’s done or its quality.  It’s a core feature related to the game’s mechanics.



**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a performance characteristic of the product – its ability to handle a specific volume of transactions.  It’s not a feature of *what* the product does (e.g., “The product shall allow users to upload images”) but rather *how well* it performs under load.  Performance requirements are almost always considered non-functional because they don’t directly relate to a specific functionality.  The timeline (two years and Release 2) further emphasizes its nature as a performance target.


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on the *technical capabilities* and *performance* of the product – specifically its ability to connect and communicate with databases. It’s not about what the product *does* (like displaying a game grid or recording meeting agendas), but rather *how* it functions technically.  It’s a key performance indicator (KPI) related to system integration and reliability.

This falls squarely into the category of non-functional requirements, specifically concerning design and governance.


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a performance metric – specifically, the speed and reliability of a process (lead cycle time). It’s not about *what* the system does, but *how quickly* and *reliably* it does it.  It focuses on a measurable performance characteristic (time) and a success rate (90% and 99%). These are hallmarks of non-functional requirements (often called “quality” requirements). 

Here's why it doesn't fit into a functional category:

*   **Not a specific function:** It doesn't describe a particular action or feature the system *must* perform.
*   **Focus on performance:** It’s entirely about the speed and reliability of the process, not the underlying functionality.


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on *usability* – how easy the interface is to use.  Usability is a core aspect of non-functional requirements, specifically relating to qualities like:

It’s not about *what* the system *does* in terms of core functionality (like processing a transaction), but rather how it handles a specific state or lack of data.  It’s a characteristic of the system’s behavior, focusing on presentation and handling of missing information.


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on *performance* – the speed at which the audit report is delivered.  Performance characteristics (like response time) are a core element of non-functional requirements (often referred to as “quality attributes”). It doesn't describe *what* the report contains or *how* it's used, but rather *how quickly* it's delivered.


**Non-Functional Requirement (Performance)**

This requirement directly addresses the speed and efficiency of a system component – the search for recycled parts.  It’s a performance requirement, specifically focusing on response time.


**Non-Functional Requirement**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a system behavior – the automatic removal of old, inactive data – rather than a specific feature or functionality. It’s about *how* the system operates and maintains its data, focusing on data management and system health, which aligns with non-functional requirements.


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a system behavior – *notifying* customers. It’s about how the system *should* operate to maintain transparency and potentially manage legal or compliance obligations. It doesn't define a specific feature or functionality, but rather a process or characteristic of the system. 

Here's why it's not a functional requirement:

*   **Functional requirements** typically describe *what* a system does (e.g., "The system shall allow users to create a new account").
*   This requirement describes *how* the system communicates information, which is a characteristic of the system's operation.


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a process and a performance target (installation time) for a system update. It’s not a description of *what* the system does (a functional requirement), but rather *how* it’s maintained and the expected speed of that maintenance.  It focuses on the system’s operational characteristics – speed, efficiency, and reliability during updates – which aligns with the definition of a non-functional requirement.


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a metric or outcome – the level of customer comfort – that is being measured. It’s not a specific feature or behavior of the system itself, but rather a desired result based on user feedback.

Non-functional requirements often deal with qualities like performance, scalability, reliability, and usability.


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a *capability* of the system – the ability to generate a report. It doesn’t specify *how* the system should perform, *what* data it should use, or *how* the user should interact with it. It’s a characteristic of the system’s behavior, rather than a specific feature or function. 

Here's why it fits the non-functional category:

*   **Performance/Usability:** It’s about the *quality* of the output (a printable summary) and the ease with which the user can obtain it.
*   **Not a Core Feature:** It’s not a fundamental function like “add a new user” or “search for a repair facility.” It’s an auxiliary capability.


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on *performance* – specifically, the speed at which users can access the website. It’s about the system’s responsiveness and usability, rather than what the system *does* (like displaying data or processing transactions).  Performance characteristics like response time are core aspects of non-functional requirements.


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes *what* the system *does* – it displays an audit report. This directly relates to the system's core functionality and how it interacts with the user.  It’s not about *how* it’s done (e.g., the user interface, performance) but rather the output of a process.


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on a measurable outcome – 90% of users being able to log into the system within 10 minutes – rather than describing *what* the system *does* (e.g., "The system shall process disputes"). It’s a performance target related to user experience and training effectiveness. It’s a key characteristic of the system’s operation, not a functional behavior.


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

It’s not about *what* the user does with the data, but *how* the system manages it.


**Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a specific action a user can perform within the system – adding clinical classes or sections to a sequence of classes. It dictates *what* the system should do, rather than simply describing a quality or characteristic.  It’s about a defined process and functionality.


**Non-Functional Requirement**

Here’s why:

*   **Focus on System Behavior:** This requirement describes *how* the RFS system interacts with the BDW environment – specifically the data loading process. It’s not about what the system *does* (e.g., calculates something) but *how* it performs a specific task.
*   **Performance & Integration:** The key aspects are the timeframe (3 hours), the number of files (7), and the frequency of loading (yearly). These are all related to system performance, integration, and data synchronization.
*   **Testability:** This requirement is easily testable – you can measure the time it takes to load the data and verify the number of files are correctly transferred.

**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**

This requirement focuses on the *usability* and *learnability* of the system. It’s not about *what* the system does (a functional requirement), but rather *how easily* a user can accomplish tasks within it.  The emphasis on “without instruction” and “understand and remember” directly relates to the user experience and the system’s intuitiveness – key aspects of non-functional requirements.


**Non-Functional**

**Reasoning:**

This requirement describes a constraint on *how* the system should operate – the formatting of output. It’s not about *what* the system does (its functionality), but rather a technical constraint on its behavior.  Constraints like this are typically categorized as non-functional requirements because they define qualities like performance, reliability, or usability, rather than core features.


**Non-Functional Requirement (Performance)**

This requirement specifically addresses *performance*, focusing on the system's speed and responsiveness under a particular network condition (a 56k connection). It’s a key aspect of system quality and user experience.


**Non-Functional Requirement** 

**Reasoning:**
