Based on the given requirement, I would classify it under the following categories:

- Functional
- Usability
- Availability 

The reason for this classification is as follows:

- Functional: The requirement describes the functionality of the Dispute System, specifically the ability to follow up on a dispute case and the filtering of follow-up actions based on the case status and user access level.
- Usability: The requirement also mentions the user interface aspect, specifically that the list of available follow-up actions must be filtered by the status of the case and the access level of the user, which implies that the system should provide a clear and intuitive way for users to follow up on dispute cases.
- Availability: Although the requirement does not directly mention availability, it implies that the system should be able to handle the filtering of follow-up actions based on the case status and user access level, which suggests that the system should be able to operate within a reasonable timeframe and handle the required functionality.

The given requirement can be classified under the following categories:

- Availability: The requirement implies that the system must be able to handle and process data for a certain period of time, which is related to the availability of the system.
- Security: Although not directly related, the requirement of purging data after a certain period of time implies that the system must have a mechanism to manage and secure its data.
- Performance: The requirement of purging data after a certain period of time implies that the system must be able to handle and process large amounts of data efficiently, which is related to performance.
- Maintainability: The requirement of purging data after a certain period of time implies that the system must have a mechanism to manage and maintain its data, which is related to maintainability.
- Scalability: The requirement of purging data after a certain period of time implies that the system must be able to handle and process large amounts of data, which is related to scalability.

However, if I had to choose one category that best fits this requirement, I would say it is: 

- Availability
