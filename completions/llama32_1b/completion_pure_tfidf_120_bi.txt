Based on the given requirement, I would classify it as a **Non-functional requirement**.

The reason is that it specifies a performance characteristic (page loading times) that is not related to the functional behavior of the system, but rather to the user's experience and the system's responsiveness. Non-functional requirements typically describe constraints on the system's performance, usability, or other qualities that are not directly related to its primary function.

Based on the given requirement, I would classify it as a **Non-functional requirement**.

The reason is that this requirement is related to the system's reliability, availability, and performance, rather than its functional behavior. Specifically, it deals with the system's ability to store and manage data, which is a non-functional aspect of the system. The fact that high availability takes priority over strict data consistency also suggests that this is a non-functional requirement, as it prioritizes the system's availability over its data consistency.
