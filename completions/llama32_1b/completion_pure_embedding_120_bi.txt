Based on the given requirement, I would classify it as a Functional Requirement.

The reason is that this requirement describes a specific action that the system should perform (print a receipt, update system parameters, and dispense money) when a certain condition is met (a successful transaction). This is a clear example of a functional requirement, which describes what the system should do, rather than how it should do it or what properties it should have.
