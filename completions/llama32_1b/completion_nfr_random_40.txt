The given requirement: Migration from MySQL 5.6.35 to MariaDB 10.6.3 - Queries not working can be classified into the following categories:

- Availability: 
  - Queries not working implies that the system is not functioning as expected, which can be a critical issue for availability.

- Security:
  - Although not directly related, security can be a concern during database migrations, especially if the migration process involves changes to database schema or data.

- Maintainability:
  - The requirement to migrate from one database management system to another can be a complex process that requires careful planning and execution, which can impact maintainability.

- Performance:
  - Although not explicitly mentioned, the fact that queries are not working can imply performance issues, as the system may be unable to handle the workload or may be experiencing errors.

- Portability:
  - Although not directly related, the migration process may require changes to the application code to ensure portability between the two database management systems.

However, the most relevant category for the given requirement is Availability, as the primary concern is that the queries are not working, which can impact the system's ability to function as expected.
