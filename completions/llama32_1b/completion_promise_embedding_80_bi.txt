The given requirement 'The search for the preferred repair facility shall take no longer than 8 seconds. The preferred repair facility is returned within 8 seconds' can be classified as both Functional and Non-functional.

The reason for this classification is that the requirement specifies a specific time limit for the search and return of the preferred repair facility, which is a functional requirement. However, the requirement also mentions the performance metric of the system (i.e., the time taken for the search and return), which is a non-functional requirement.

Therefore, the classification is: Functional (specifying the requirement) and Non-functional (specifying the performance metric).

Both requirements are Functional.

However, the second requirement is a repetition of the first one, so it can be classified as a Duplicate Functional Requirement.


Both requirements are Non-functional.
