import java.net.URL;

public class NamecheapDNSUpdater {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        String apiSecret = "YOUR_API_SECRET";
        String domain = "example.com";

        // Get API endpoint URL
        String endpointUrl = "https://api.namecheap.com/xmlResponse.php?c=domain&method=update&apikey=" + apiKey + "&apiuser=" + apiSecret + "&domain=" + domain;

        try {
            // Send HTTP request to Namecheap API
            URL url = new URL(endpointUrl);
            HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
            connection.setRequestMethod("GET");

            // Check if the request was successful
            int responseCode = connection.getResponseCode();
            if (responseCode == 200) {
                // Read the response
                BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(connection.getInputStream()));
                String line;
                while ((line = reader.readLine())!= null) {
                    System.out.println(line);
                }
                reader.close();
            } else {
                System.out.println("Failed to update DNS: " + responseCode);
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Error updating DNS: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

Please note that you need to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` and `YOUR_API_SECRET` with your actual Namecheap API credentials. Also, this is a basic example and may not cover all possible scenarios. You should consider implementing error handling and other features as per your requirements.

Key-Value based databases are simple, lightweight, and ideal for storing and retrieving data based on a unique key. Here's a practical example:

**Use Case:** A social media platform wants to store user profiles.

**Practical Steps:**

1. Create a key-value store (e.g., Redis or Riak) to store user profiles.
2. Each user is assigned a unique identifier (key).
3. Store user data (e.g., name, email, profile picture) as values associated with the key.
4. When a user logs in, retrieve their profile data using the unique identifier (key).
5. Update user data by updating the corresponding value associated with the key.

This example demonstrates how key-value databases can be used to store and retrieve data efficiently, making them suitable for applications with simple data storage needs.
