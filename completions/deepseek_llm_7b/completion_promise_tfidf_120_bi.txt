This requirement can be classified as both functional and non-functional.

It is functional because it talks about the need for the product to comply with specific page standards and requirements of ENET Securities, which implies that the product's design and functionality should meet certain expectations in order to be approved by the Architecture group prior to implementation.

On the other hand, it is also non-functional because it sets a threshold (95% approval) for the look and feel of the product, indicating that there is an expectation for the remaining 5% of the product's design and functionality to be corrected and approved within one month of product release. This means that the non-functional characteristics of the product will have to meet certain standards as well in order to ensure a satisfactory user experience.


This requirement can be classified as a performance-based non-functional requirement. It specifies the desired behavior of the system in terms of completing the total lead cycle time (i.e., the amount of time it takes to process a lead from start to finish) for 90% of the lead volume between specific business hours and for 99% of the lead volume during off-business hours.


This requirement can be classified as a Fit/Gap analysis criteria since it compares the proposed interface design with the user's expectations or needs. Here, the system is expected to have a simple look that is perceived as adequate by 90% of beta testers.
