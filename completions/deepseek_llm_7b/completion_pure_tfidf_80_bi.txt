The given requirement can be classified as both functional and non-functional. From a functional perspective, it describes a feature of the MultiMahjongClient application that allows users to save their preferences and retrieve them upon launching the app. This means that whenever a user customizes settings or saves game progress within the MultiMahjongClient, these changes should be preserved across different instances of the software (e.g., when restarting the app) via this feature.

However, from a non-functional perspective, saving and loading user preferences is also essential for maintaining data consistency and usability throughout the application's lifetime. Users expect that their settings will not get lost after closing or relaunching the MultiMahjongClient, which implies that implementing efficient save/load mechanisms in terms of performance (e.g., speed), memory usage (e.g., space), error handling (e.g., data corruption) and user experience (e.g., smooth transition between sessions) is crucial to deliver an enjoyable application.

In summary, the given requirement can be classified as a functional feature that encompasses both aspects of preserving users' preferences for better usability and maintaining consistency in user interface settings across multiple instances of MultiMahjongClient.

The given requirement can be classified as both functional and non-functional depending on the context and perspective of the system it is being applied to. 

From a functional standpoint, this requirement pertains to managing user accounts within an LMS (Learning Management System) which is a core aspect of the system's functionality. Storing information about librarians and patrons including their access keys and priority can help manage user roles, permissions, and other relevant details in order to provide appropriate access to resources and content within the LMS.

On the non-functional side, this requirement could impact aspects like scalability, security, performance, and maintainability of the system. Storing detailed information about users would require careful planning for database design, data modeling, and efficient indexing techniques to ensure fast query responses. Additionally, appropriate access control mechanisms should be in place to secure sensitive user details while maintaining compliance with privacy regulations.

In summary, this requirement can be both functional (managing user accounts) and non-functional (implications on scalability, performance, security, etc.).
