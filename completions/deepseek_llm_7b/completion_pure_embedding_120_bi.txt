This requirement pertains to a function of the APAF (Airport Performance Audit File) system, which is related to the classification of air traffic control data. The system will receive telemetry data from ESOC (European Space Operations Centre), specifically for ASPERA-3 Experiment and Mars Express Orbit/Attitude. This information would be used for analysis and audit purposes within the aviation industry.

The classification as Non-functional is because this requirement focuses on the aspects that are not related to functional requirements such as testing types (traversing all forms, stress testing), and testing type (Authorization tests). These aspects deal with the quality of the Stock Master system, how it will be tested, and what kind of tests will be performed.
