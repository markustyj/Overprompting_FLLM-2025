This requirement can be classified into the following categories: Functional Suitability, Usability, Performance Efficiency.

Functional Suitability: This category relates to the functionality of the system and whether it is able to fulfill a specific task or process. In this case, the requirement asks for the system to display a printable summary for individual clinical sites, including information on labs being held at that site during a given quarter (such as dates and times of all labs). Therefore, this requirement falls under Functional Suitability.

Usability: This category relates to how easily a system can be used by its intended audience. The requirement asks for a printable summary, which implies that the system should have an interface or report format that is user-friendly and easy to understand. Additionally, it may require training for users on how to access and interpret this information effectively, making Usability a relevant category as well.

Performance Efficiency: This category relates to the speed at which a system can process tasks or run queries. While there isn't any explicit mention of performance efficiency in this requirement, there might be concerns about the system's ability to handle large volumes of data for multiple sites and quarters. For example, if the system needs to generate reports with information on labs being held at various clinical sites across different quarters, it could pose a challenge regarding its speed and performance efficiency.


The given software requirement can be classified into the following category: 'Reliability'. This is because it emphasizes the need for the product to be available continuously without any downtime for a period of seven days, which aligns with the concept of reliability in software requirements.
