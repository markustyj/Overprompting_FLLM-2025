The given software requirement "The MultiMahjongClient will save the user preferences in a file and read them in when the program begins." can be classified as both functional and non-functional requirements. 

Functional Requirement - The MultiMahj JongClient should have features that enable users to interact with the application, such as saving their preferences and reading from the preferences on startup. This functionality will provide an improved user experience by personalizing the gameplay settings according to individual user's needs (e.g., setting difficulty levels, selecting preferred themes or backgrounds).

Non-Functional Requirement - The MultiMahjongClient should be able to save data in a file format that can be read and understood efficiently by other programs or components of the system (such as game state management systems) without causing performance issues when loading. It also needs to ensure proper error handling, security measures for protecting user preferences from unauthorized access, and appropriate communication with other players via a network connection if multiplayer mode is enabled in the application.
