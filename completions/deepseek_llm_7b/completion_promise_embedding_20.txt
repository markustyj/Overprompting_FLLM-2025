This software requirement can be classified into two categories: Performance and Scalability. The performance aspect is because it mentions handling up to 10 simultaneous users, which requires efficient resource allocation for concurrent tasks and quick response times during peak usage hours. The scalability aspect is because the system needs to expand its capacity according to user demand by accommodating more users (up to 10) within a specific timeframe (9am to 5pm).
