This requirement can be classified as both fit-criterion and non-fit-criterion.

As a fit-criterion, it states that user access should be limited by their assigned roles, which is in line with principle of least privilege (POLP) - a security concept where users are given only the minimum privileges necessary to perform their tasks. This helps reduce the risk of unauthorized access or misuse of system resources. Therefore, this requirement aligns with the system's need for secure access control and can be considered as fit-criterion.

As a non-fit-criterion, it mentions that each level in the hierarchy will have valid users assigned to roles, implying a complex role assignment structure which may not align with organizational hierarchy or PCG framework. Therefore, this requirement needs further clarification on how user assignments to roles are managed and enforced within the RFS system before being considered as fit-criterion.
