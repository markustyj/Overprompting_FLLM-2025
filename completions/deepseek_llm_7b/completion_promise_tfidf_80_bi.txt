Justification: The given requirement is focusing on the performance aspect of the software, specifically how quickly it should process a significant portion of its workload under specific conditions. It specifies the desired cycle time for handling a large percentage of leads within a certain timeframe (business hours and off business hours). This falls under the category of non-functional requirements as it deals with the efficiency and performance of the system rather than its functionality or what the system is supposed to do.

Justify: This requirement is asking for a specific performance characteristic of the product, which is related to its interface speed or responsiveness. It specifies that the response time should not exceed a certain threshold (2 seconds for 90% of the time and 10 seconds for 10% of the time) making it a non-functional requirement.

Justification: The given requirement is related to the functionality of the software being able to be translated into foreign languages other than the target market countries' languages in future releases. This falls under the functional category as it describes a feature or capability that the software will have in future versions. Additionally, the mention of configuring the product for each emerging target market within 5 days is also related to how well the software can be adapted and deployed in different environments, which further supports its classification as non-functional.
