This software requirement can be classified into the "Security" category. The main focus of this requirement is to ensure that the system maintains a consistent level of security by updating user passwords and permissions throughout the entire system whenever there are changes.


This software requirement can be classified into two categories: Functional Suitability and Performance Efficiency. 

Functional Suitability: This category relates to how the system should behave based on specific conditions or circumstances, such as in this case when the leads score falls within the high average score. The requirement states that if this occurs, it will trigger a process called ARA (Automatic Request Assignment) functionality. Therefore, Functional Suitibility is an appropriate classification for this requirement because it deals with how the system should react based on certain conditions.

Performance Efficiency: This category relates to how quickly and efficiently the system performs tasks or responds to inputs. In this case, the performance efficiency of the system is a key aspect of the requirement - specifically, the response time must not exceed 2 seconds for at least 95% of responses. Therefore, Performance Efficiency is an appropriate classification for this requirement as it deals with how quickly and efficiently the system processes information.


The given software requirement falls under the 'Security' category.
