This requirement can be classified into several categories: Functional, Maintainability, Operational, Usability, Scalability, Security. 

1. Functional: This requirement falls under the functional category as it concerns displaying information about individual cohorts, which includes students enlisted in the cohort, program of study, sequence of classes, and progress through the program. The system's ability to display this kind of data is a core functionality of the software.

2. Maintainability: This requirement pertains to maintainability because maintaining a comprehensive record of cohort information would be essential for ensuring accurate tracking of students' progression in their studies. A detailed summary for each cohort should be easily modifiable and adaptable as new cohorts or courses are added, without disrupting other features of the system.

3. Operational: This requirement belongs to the operational category because it specifies how users will access information about cohorts (printable summaries). The printing feature is a fundamental aspect of an operable software solution that enables stakeholders like Program Administrators and Nursing Staff Members to print important cohort data when needed. 

4. Usability: User-friendliness comes into play as this requirement emphasizes the need for a comprehensive, yet easily navigable report on individual cohorts. The summary should be designed in such a way that it is readily understood by its intended audience.

5. Scalability: This criterion applies because tracking cohort progress accurately and comprehensively over an extended period requires a system capable of accommodating numerous students and classes across various programs, courses, and timeframes. 

6. Security: Given the nature of sensitive information (such as personal details of students and program-related data), this requirement falls under security to ensure that appropriate controls are in place to protect the privacy and confidentiality of user data.

Usability


This software requirement can be classified into several categories such as Operational, Security, and Usability. From an operational standpoint, allowing both internal and external users to access the system could imply that different levels of access controls or permissions might need to be put in place for security purposes. Additionally, it could have implications on usability since these two groups of users may have different requirements or expectations from the software. Furthermore, this requirement could also fall under a Legal category as it relates to user agreements and data privacy concerns between internal versus external users.

Security


This software requirement can be classified into two categories: Fault Tolerance and Operational. 

Fault Tolerance: The requirement states that the product should help System Administrators and DBAs to resolve transaction errors, which indicates a need for fault-tolerant design in order to recover from errors efficiently. So, this falls under the category of Fault Tolerance.

Operational: Error tracking services are an essential part of maintaining system performance, so it's also relevant to the operational aspect of the software product as well. The System Administrators and DBAs need to be able to track and resolve errors in a timely manner for smooth operations, which is why this requirement falls under Operational as well.
