The given software requirement can be classified as both functional and non-functional requirements. It is considered as a functional requirement because it sets specific constraints on the software's memory usage during operation (less than 10MB ideally; 20MB maximum). This constraint helps ensure that the application runs efficiently without consuming excessive resources, which could impact system performance or user experience.

At the same time, this requirement can be considered a non-functional requirement because it outlines specific constraints on the software's storage space requirements. These constraints might have implications for how well the software operates within its resource limits and may influence various other aspects of its behavior, such as responsiveness to user input or handling of certain data loads.

In summary, while this requirement primarily focuses on a functional constraint related to memory usage during operation, it also has non-functional implications due to specific storage space limitations being set for the software's use.
