This statement is a functional requirement because it describes a feature that the product needs to have in order to be usable by its intended audience (end users). The ability for the product to be highly configurable and easily adaptable to various database management systems is a crucial function, as it allows for greater flexibility and usability by different user groups. This can be achieved without changing the product's software code, which indicates that end users should not need specialized technical knowledge or assistance in order to integrate new database management systems with the product.

Justification: This requirement is asking for a specific performance characteristic of the product, specifically the speed at which it responds to user inputs or processes requests. The focus here is on ensuring that users do not experience prolonged delays when interacting with the interface, but rather have a responsive and smooth experience. Therefore, this falls under non-functional as it relates to qualities like usability, performance, and efficiency of the software.

Justify: The justification for classifying this requirement as functional is that it focuses on the system's performance in terms of response time, which is a functional characteristic. The non-functional requirements are mainly concerned with aspects such as availability, reliability, maintainability, and efficiency. This particular requirement is more focused on how the system behaves under specific network conditions (56k connection), rather than overall system behavior or constraints.
