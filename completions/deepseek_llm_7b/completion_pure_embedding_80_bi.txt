The given requirement can be classified as both functional and non-functional.

From a functional standpoint, this requirement is asking about the system's ability to support multiple users accessing the system during specific time intervals. The system needs to be designed in such a way that it can handle 10 simultaneous users for a duration of 8 hours (from 9am to 5pm). This means that the user interface, database queries, and other functional aspects of the system need to be optimized to ensure smooth functioning during these hours.

From a non-functional standpoint, this requirement is also asking about various qualities of the system, such as performance, availability, scalability, and response times. The system should have enough resources (e.g., CPU, memory, storage) to handle 10 simultaneous users effectively and efficiently. It must be highly available and accessible for most of the time with minimal downtime during these hours. Moreover, it needs to respond quickly to user actions within a reasonable timeframe, ensuring that all users get a seamless experience even if there are multiple interactions happening simultaneously.

In summary, this requirement is both functional (to cater to simultaneous users) and non-functional (in terms of performance, availability, scalability, etc.).
